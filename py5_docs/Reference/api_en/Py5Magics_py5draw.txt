@@ description
Create a PNG image with py5 and embed the result in the notebook.

For users who are familiar with Processing and py5 programming, you can pretend the code in this cell will be executed in a Sketch with no ``draw()`` function and your code in the ``setup()`` function. By default it will use the default Processing renderer.

Code used in this cell can reference functions and variables defined in other cells. By default, variables and functions created in this cell will be local to only this cell because to do otherwise would be unsafe. If you understand the risks, you can use the ``global`` keyword to add a single function or variable to the notebook namespace or the ``--unsafe`` argument to add everything to the notebook namespace. Either option may be very useful to you, but be aware that using py5 objects in a different notebook cell or reusing them in another Sketch can result in nasty errors and bizzare consequences.
