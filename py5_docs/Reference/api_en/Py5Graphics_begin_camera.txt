@@ description
The ``begin_camera()`` and :doc:`py5graphics_end_camera` functions enable advanced customization of the camera space. The functions are useful if you want to more control over camera movement, however for most users, the :doc:`py5graphics_camera` function will be sufficient. The camera functions will replace any transformations (such as :doc:`py5graphics_rotate` or :doc:`py5graphics_translate`) that occur before them in ``draw()``, but they will not automatically replace the camera transform itself. For this reason, camera functions should be placed at the beginning of ``draw()`` (so that transformations happen afterwards), and the :doc:`py5graphics_camera` function can be used after ``begin_camera()`` if you want to reset the camera before applying transformations.

This function sets the matrix mode to the camera matrix so calls such as :doc:`py5graphics_translate`, :doc:`py5graphics_rotate`, :doc:`py5graphics_apply_matrix` and :doc:`py5graphics_reset_matrix` affect the camera. ``begin_camera()`` should always be used with a following :doc:`py5graphics_end_camera` and pairs of ``begin_camera()`` and :doc:`py5graphics_end_camera` cannot be nested.

This method is the same as :doc:`begin_camera` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`begin_camera`.
