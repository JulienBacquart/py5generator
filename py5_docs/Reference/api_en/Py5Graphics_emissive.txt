@@ description
Sets the emissive color of the material used for drawing shapes drawn to the screen. Use in combination with [](py5graphics_ambient), [](py5graphics_specular), and [](py5graphics_shininess) to set the material properties of shapes.

This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g. "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online ["All About Colors"](/integrations/colors) Python Ecosystem Integration tutorial for more information.

This method is the same as [](sketch_emissive) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_emissive).
