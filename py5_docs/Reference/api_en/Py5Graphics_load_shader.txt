@@ description
Loads a shader into a ``Py5Shader`` object. The shader file must be loaded in the Sketch's "data" directory to load correctly. Shaders are compatible with the ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` renderers, but not with the default renderer.

Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.

If the file is not available or an error occurs, ``None`` will be returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt the program, however the ``None`` value may cause an error if your code does not check whether the value returned is ``None``.

This method is the same as :doc:`load_shader` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`load_shader`.
