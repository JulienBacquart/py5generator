text_descent() -> float

@@ description
Returns descent of the current font at its current size. This information is useful for determining the height of the font below the baseline.

This method is the same as :doc:`text_descent` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`text_descent`.
