@@ description
Sets a texture to be applied to vertex points. The ``texture()`` function must be called between ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()`` and before any calls to ``vertex()``. This function only works with the P2D and P3D renderers.

When textures are in use, the fill color is ignored. Instead, use ``tint()`` to specify the color of the texture as it is applied to the shape.

@@ example
image = texture_.png

size(100, 100, P3D)
no_stroke()
img = load_image("laDefense.jpg")
begin_shape()
texture(img)
vertex(10, 20, 0, 0)
vertex(80, 5, 100, 0)
vertex(95, 90, 100, 100)
vertex(40, 95, 0, 100)
end_shape()
