@@ description
Sets a texture to be applied to vertex points. The ``texture()`` function must be called between ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()`` and before any calls to ``vertex()``. This function only works with the P2D and P3D renderers.

When textures are in use, the fill color is ignored. Instead, use ``tint()`` to specify the color of the texture as it is applied to the shape.

@@ example
image = Sketch_texture_0.png

py5.size(100, 100, py5.P3D)
py5.no_stroke()
img = py5.load_image("laDefense.jpg")
py5.begin_shape()
py5.texture(img)
py5.vertex(10, 20, 0, 0)
py5.vertex(80, 5, 100, 0)
py5.vertex(95, 90, 100, 100)
py5.vertex(40, 95, 0, 100)
py5.end_shape()
