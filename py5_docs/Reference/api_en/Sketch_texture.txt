## description
Sets a texture to be applied to vertex points. The <b>texture()</b> function must be called between <b>beginShape()</b> and <b>endShape()</b> and before any calls to <b>vertex()</b>. This function only works with the P2D and P3D renderers.<br />
<br />
When textures are in use, the fill color is ignored. Instead, use <b>tint()</b> to specify the color of the texture as it is applied to the shape.

## example
image = texture_.png

size(100, 100, P3D);
noStroke();
PImage img = loadImage("laDefense.jpg");
beginShape();
texture(img);
vertex(10, 20, 0, 0);
vertex(80, 5, 100, 0);
vertex(95, 90, 100, 100);
vertex(40, 95, 0, 100);
endShape();
