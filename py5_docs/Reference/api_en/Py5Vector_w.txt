@@ description
The vector's w dimension value. This is the vector's 4th dimension, and is only applicable to 4D vectors.

@@ example
v = py5.Py5Vector(1, 2, 3, 4)

print(v.x, v.y, v.z, v.w)
# 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0

v.x = 0
v.y += 10
v.z += 100
v.w += 1000

print(v.x, v.y, v.z, v.w)
# 0.0, 12.0, 103.0, 1004.0
