@@ description
Set the Sketch window's title. This will typically appear at the window's title bar. The default window title is "Sketch".

This method provides the same funcationality as :doc:`py5surface_set_title` but without the need to interact directly with the :doc:`py5surface` object.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.size(200, 200)
    py5.window_title("py5 window")
