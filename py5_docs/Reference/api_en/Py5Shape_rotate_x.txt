rotate_x(angle: float, /) -> None

angle: float - angle of rotation specified in radians

@@ description
Rotates the shape around the x-axis the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from 0 to TWO_PI) or converted from degrees to radians with the ``radians()`` method.

Shapes are always rotated around the upper-left corner of their bounding box. Positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise direction. Subsequent calls to the method accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``rotate_x(HALF_PI)`` and then ``rotate_x(HALF_PI)`` is the same as ``rotate_x(PI)``. This transformation is applied directly to the shape, it's not refreshed each time ``draw()`` is run.  

This method requires a 3D renderer. You need to use P3D as a third parameter for the ``size()`` function as shown in the example above.

@@ example
def settings():
    py5.size(100, 100, py5.P3D)


def setup():
    global s
    s = py5.load_shape("bot.svg")


def draw():
    py5.background(204)
    py5.scale(0.2)
    py5.shape(s, py5.width // 2, py5.height // 2)


def mouse_pressed():
    # rotate the shape around the x-axis each time the mouse is pressed
    s.rotate_x(0.1)
