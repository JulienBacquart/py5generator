select_folder(prompt: str, callback: Callable, default_folder: str = None) -> None

callback: Callable - callback function after selection is made
default_folder: str = None - default folder
prompt: str - text prompt for select dialog box

@@ description
Opens a file chooser dialog to select a folder. After the selection is made, the selection will be passed to the ``callback`` function. If the dialog is closed or canceled, ``None`` will be sent to the function, so that the program is not waiting for additional input. The callback is necessary because of how threading works.
