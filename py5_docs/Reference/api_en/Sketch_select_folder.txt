select_folder(prompt: str, callback: Callable, default_folder: str = None) -> None

@@ variables
callback: Callable - callback function after selection is made
default_folder: str = None - default folder
prompt: str - text prompt for select dialog box

@@ description
Opens a file chooser dialog to select a folder. After the selection is made, the selection will be passed to the `callback` function. If the dialog is closed or canceled, `None` will be sent to the function, so that the program is not waiting for additional input. The callback is necessary because of how threading works.

This method has some platform specific quirks. On OSX, this does not work when the Sketch is run through a Jupyter notebook. On Windows, Sketches using the OpenGL renderers (`P2D` or `P3D`) will be minimized while the select dialog box is open. This method only uses native dialog boxes on OSX.

@@ example
def folder_selected(selection):
    if selection is None:
        py5.println("Window was closed or the user hit cancel.")
    else:
        py5.println("User selected " + selection)


def setup():
    py5.select_folder("Select a folder to process:", folder_selected)
