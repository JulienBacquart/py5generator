@@ description
Sets a `Py5Shape` object's emissive color. This is part of the material properties of a `Py5Shape` object.

The `emissive` parameter can be applied to the entire `Py5Shape` object or to a single vertex.

This method can only be used for a complete `Py5Shape` object, and never within a [](py5shape_begin_shape) and [](py5shape_end_shape) pair.

This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g. "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online ["All About Colors"](/integrations/colors) Python Ecosystem Integration tutorial for more information.

    py5.no_stroke()
    s = py5.create_shape(py5.SPHERE, 20)

    s.set_emissive("#003264")
