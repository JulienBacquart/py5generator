@@ description
The ``begin_camera()`` and ``end_camera()`` functions enable advanced customization of the camera space. The functions are useful if you want to more control over camera movement, however for most users, the ``camera()`` function will be sufficient.The camera functions will replace any transformations (such as ``rotate()`` or ``translate()``) that occur before them in ``draw()``, but they will not automatically replace the camera transform itself. For this reason, camera functions should be placed at the beginning of ``draw()`` (so that transformations happen afterwards), and the ``camera()`` function can be used after ``begin_camera()`` if you want to reset the camera before applying transformations.This function sets the matrix mode to the camera matrix so calls such as ``translate()``, ``rotate()``, ``apply_matrix()````reset_matrix()``rix() affect the camera. ``begin_camera()`` should always be used with a following ``end_camera()`` and pairs of ``begin_camera()`` and ``end_camera()`` cannot be nested.

image = beginCamera_.png

size(100, 100, P3D);
noFill();

beginCamera();
camera();
rotateX(-PI/6);
endCamera();

translate(50, 50, 0);
rotateY(PI/3);
box(45);
