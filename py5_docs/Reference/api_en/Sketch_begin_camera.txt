@@ description
The <b>beginCamera()</b> and <b>endCamera()</b> functions enable advanced customization of the camera space. The functions are useful if you want to more control over camera movement, however for most users, the <b>camera()</b> function will be sufficient.<br /><br />The camera functions will replace any transformations (such as <b>rotate()</b> or <b>translate()</b>) that occur before them in <b>draw()</b>, but they will not automatically replace the camera transform itself. For this reason, camera functions should be placed at the beginning of <b>draw()</b> (so that transformations happen afterwards), and the <b>camera()</b> function can be used after <b>beginCamera()</b> if you want to reset the camera before applying transformations.<br /><br />This function sets the matrix mode to the camera matrix so calls such as <b>translate()</b>, <b>rotate()</b>, applyMatrix() and resetMatrix() affect the camera. <b>beginCamera()</b> should always be used with a following <b>endCamera()</b> and pairs of <b>beginCamera()</b> and <b>endCamera()</b> cannot be nested.

image = beginCamera_.png

size(100, 100, P3D);
noFill();

beginCamera();
camera();
rotateX(-PI/6);
endCamera();

translate(50, 50, 0);
rotateY(PI/3);
box(45);
