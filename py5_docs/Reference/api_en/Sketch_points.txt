coordinates: NDArray[(Any, Any), Float] - array of point coordinates

@@ description
Draw a collection of points, each a coordinate in space at the dimension of one pixel. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling :doc:`sketch_point` in a loop. For a large number of points, the performance of ``points()`` will be much faster.

The ``coordinates`` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each point. There should be two or three columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively.

@@ example
image = Sketch_points_0.png

import numpy as np

def setup():
    random_points = 100 * np.random.rand(500, 2)
    py5.points(random_points)
