bezier_detail(detail: int, /) -> None

detail: int - resolution of the curves

@@ description
Sets the resolution at which Beziers display. The default value is 20. This function is only useful when using the ``P3D`` renderer; the default ``P2D`` renderer does not use this information.

This method is the same as :doc:`bezier_detail` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`bezier_detail`.
