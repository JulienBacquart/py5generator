@@ description
This method is used to start a custom closed shape created with the [](sketch_create_shape) function. It's always and only used with [](sketch_create_shape).

This method should only be used as a context manager, as shown in the example. When used as a context manager, this will ensure that [](py5shape_end_shape) always gets called, just like when using [](py5shape_begin_shape) as a context manager. The difference is that when exiting, the parameter `CLOSE` will be passed to [](py5shape_end_shape), connecting the last vertex to the first. This will close the shape. If this method were to be used not as a context manager, it won't be able to close the shape by making the call to [](py5shape_end_shape).

    global s  # the Py5Shape object

    with s.begin_closed_shape():
        s.stroke_weight(5)
        s.no_fill()
        s.vertex(0, 0)
        s.vertex(0, 50)
        s.vertex(50, 0)
