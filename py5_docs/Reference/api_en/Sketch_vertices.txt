@@ description
Create a collection of vertices. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling :doc:`vertex` in a loop. For a large number of vertices, the performance of ``vertices()`` will be much faster.

The ``coordinates`` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each vertex. There should be two or three columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively.

@@ example
image = Sketch_vertices_0.png

import numpy as np

def setup():
    random_triangle_vertices = 100 * np.random.rand(25, 2)
    py5.begin_shape(py5.TRIANGLES)
    py5.vertices(random_triangle_vertices)
    py5.end_shape()
