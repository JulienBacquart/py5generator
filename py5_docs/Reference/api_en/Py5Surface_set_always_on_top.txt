always: bool - should the Sketch window always be on top of other windows

@@ description
Set the Sketch window to always be on top of other windows. By default, the Sketch window can be covered by other windows. Setting this to `True` will keep that from happening.

@@ example
def setup():
    surface = py5.get_surface()
    surface.set_title("py5 window")
    surface.set_always_on_top(True)
    surface.set_icon(py5.load_image("logo-64x64.png"))
