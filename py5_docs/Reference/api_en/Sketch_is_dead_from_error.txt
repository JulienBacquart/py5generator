@@ description
Boolean value reflecting if the Sketch has been run and has now stopped because of an error. This will be ``True`` only when :doc:`sketch_is_dead` is ``True`` and the Sketch stopped because an exception was thrown.

@@ example
import time

def setup():
    py5.background(255, 0, 0)


print("the sketch is ready:", py5.is_ready)

py5.run_sketch()

print("the sketch is running:", py5.is_running)

py5.exit_sketch()

# wait for exit_sketch to complete
time.sleep(1)

print("the sketch is dead:", py5.is_dead)
