@@ description
The system variable ``mouse_x`` always contains the current horizontal coordinate of the mouse.

Note that Processing can only track the mouse position when the pointer is over the current window. The default value of ``mouse_x`` is ``0``, so ``0`` will be returned until the mouse moves in front of the sketch window. (This typically happens when a sketch is first run.)  Once the mouse moves away from the window, ``mouse_x`` will continue to report its most recent position.

@@ example
void draw() {
  background(204)
  line(mouseX, 20, mouseX, 80)
}
