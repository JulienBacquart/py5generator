@@ description
Sets the default ambient light, directional light, falloff, and specular values. The defaults are ``ambientLight(128, 128, 128)`` and ``directionalLight(128, 128, 128, 0, 0, -1)``, ``lightFalloff(1, 0, 0)``, and ``lightSpecular(0, 0, 0)``. Lights need to be included in the ``draw()`` to remain persistent in a looping program. Placing them in the ``setup()`` of a looping program will cause them to only have an effect the first time through the loop.

This method is the same as :doc:`lights` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`lights`.
