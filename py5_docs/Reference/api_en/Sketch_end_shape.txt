@@ description
The ``end_shape()`` function is the companion to :doc:`sketch_begin_shape` and may only be called after :doc:`sketch_begin_shape`. When ``end_shape()`` is called, all of image data defined since the previous call to :doc:`sketch_begin_shape` is written into the image buffer. The constant ``CLOSE`` as the value for the ``MODE`` parameter to close the shape (to connect the beginning and the end).

@@ example
image = Sketch_end_shape_0.png
