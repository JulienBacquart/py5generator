@@ description
The ``end_shape()`` function is the companion to ``begin_shape()`` and may only be called after ``begin_shape()``. When ``end_shape()`` is called, all of image data defined since the previous call to ``begin_shape()`` is written into the image buffer. The constant CLOSE as the value for the MODE parameter to close the shape (to connect the beginning and the end).

@@ example
image = endShape_.png

no_fill()

begin_shape()
vertex(20, 20)
vertex(45, 20)
vertex(45, 80)
end_shape(CLOSE)

begin_shape()
vertex(50, 20)
vertex(75, 20)
vertex(75, 80)
end_shape()
