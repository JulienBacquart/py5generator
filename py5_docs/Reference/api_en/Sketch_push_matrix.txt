@@ description
Pushes the current transformation matrix onto the matrix stack. Understanding ``push_matrix()`` and ``pop_matrix()`` requires understanding the concept of a matrix stack. The ``push_matrix()`` function saves the current coordinate system to the stack and ``pop_matrix()`` restores the prior coordinate system. ``push_matrix()`` and ``pop_matrix()`` are used in conjuction with the other transformation functions and may be embedded to control the scope of the transformations.

image = pushMatrix_.png

fill(255)
rect(0, 0, 50, 50)  # White rectangle

pushMatrix()
translate(30, 20)
fill(0)  
rect(0, 0, 50, 50)  # Black rectangle
popMatrix()

fill(100)  
rect(15, 10, 50, 50)  # Gray rectangle
