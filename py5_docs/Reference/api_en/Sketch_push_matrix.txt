@@ description
Pushes the current transformation matrix onto the matrix stack. Understanding ``push_matrix()`` and ``pop_matrix()`` requires understanding the concept of a matrix stack. The ``push_matrix()`` function saves the current coordinate system to the stack and ``pop_matrix()`` restores the prior coordinate system. ``push_matrix()`` and ``pop_matrix()`` are used in conjuction with the other transformation functions and may be embedded to control the scope of the transformations.

pop_matrix()

fill(100)
rect(15, 10, 50, 50)  # gray rectangle
