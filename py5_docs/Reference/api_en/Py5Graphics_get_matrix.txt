target: npt.NDArray[np.floating] - transformation matrix with a shape of 2x3 for 2D transforms or 4x4 for 3D transforms

@@ description
Get the current matrix as a numpy array. Use the `target` parameter to put the matrix data in a properly sized and typed numpy array.

This method is the same as [](sketch_get_matrix) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_get_matrix).
