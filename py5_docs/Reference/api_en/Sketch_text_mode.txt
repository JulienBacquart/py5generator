@@ description
Sets the way text draws to the screen, either as texture maps or as vector geometry. The default ``text_mode(MODEL)``, uses textures to render the fonts. The ``text_mode(SHAPE)`` mode draws text using the glyph outlines of individual characters rather than as textures. This mode is only supported with the ``PDF`` and ``P3D`` renderer settings. With the ``PDF`` renderer, you must call ``text_mode(SHAPE)`` before any other drawing occurs. If the outlines are not available, then ``text_mode(SHAPE)`` will be ignored and ``text_mode(MODEL)`` will be used instead.

The ``text_mode(SHAPE)`` option in ``P3D`` can be combined with ``begin_raw()`` to write vector-accurate text to 2D and 3D output files, for instance ``DXF`` or ``PDF``. The ``SHAPE`` mode is not currently optimized for ``P3D``, so if recording shape data, use ``text_mode(MODEL)`` until you're ready to capture the geometry with ``begin_raw()``.

void setup() {
  size(500, 500, PDF, "TypeDemo.pdf")
  text_mode(SHAPE)
  text_size(180)

void draw() {
  text("ABC", 75, 350)
  exit()  # quit the program
