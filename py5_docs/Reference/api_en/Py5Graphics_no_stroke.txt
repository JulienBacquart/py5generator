no_stroke() -> None

@@ description
Disables drawing the stroke (outline). If both ``no_stroke()`` and :doc:`py5graphics_no_fill` are called, nothing will be drawn to the screen.

This method is the same as :doc:`sketch_no_stroke` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`sketch_no_stroke`.
