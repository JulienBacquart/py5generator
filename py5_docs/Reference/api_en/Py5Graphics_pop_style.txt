@@ description
The :doc:`py5graphics_push_style` function saves the current style settings and ``pop_style()`` restores the prior settings; these functions are always used together. They allow you to change the style settings and later return to what you had. When a new style is started with :doc:`py5graphics_push_style`, it builds on the current style information. The :doc:`py5graphics_push_style` and ``pop_style()`` functions can be embedded to provide more control (see the second example for a demonstration.)

This method is the same as :doc:`pop_style` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`pop_style`.
