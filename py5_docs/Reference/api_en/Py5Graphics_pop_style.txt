@@ description
The [](py5graphics_push_style) function saves the current style settings and `pop_style()` restores the prior settings; these functions are always used together. They allow you to change the style settings and later return to what you had. When a new style is started with [](py5graphics_push_style), it builds on the current style information. The [](py5graphics_push_style) and `pop_style()` method pairs can be nested to provide more control.

This method is the same as [](sketch_pop_style) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_pop_style).
