@@ description
Create a new vector with random values. Use the ``dim`` parameter to specify if the vector should have 2, 3, or 4 dimensions.

The new vector will have a magnitude of 1 and a heading that is uniformly distributed across all possible headings for a vector with the given dimension.

When used as a ``Py5Vector`` class method, the ``dim`` parameter is required to specify what the new vector's dimension should be. When used as a class method for the ``Py5Vector2D``, ``Py5Vector3D``, or ``Py5Vector4D`` child classes, the ``dim`` parameter is optional and will default to the dimension implied by the specific class. When used as a method on a vector instance, the ``dim`` parameter is also optional and will default to the vector instance's dimension. See the example code for examples of all of these use cases.
