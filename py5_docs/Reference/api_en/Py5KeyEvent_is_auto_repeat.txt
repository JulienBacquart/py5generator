is_auto_repeat() -> bool

@@ description
Identifies if the pressed key is auto repeating, as faciliated by the computer's operating system. This method might work differently (or not at all) depending on the renderer used by the Sketch and the operating system the Sketch is run on.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.size(200, 200, py5.P2D)
    py5.rect_mode(py5.CENTER)


def draw():
    py5.square(py5.random(py5.width), py5.random(py5.height), 10)


def key_pressed(e):
    if e.is_auto_repeat():
        py5.println('key press is auto repeating')
    else:
        py5.println('key press is not auto repeating')
