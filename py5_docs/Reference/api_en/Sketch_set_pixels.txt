@@ description
Changes the color of any pixel or writes an image directly into the drawing surface.

The `x` and `y` parameters specify the pixel to change and the color parameter specifies the color value. The color parameter `c` is affected by the current color mode (the default is RGB values from 0 to 255). When setting an image, the `x` and `y` parameters define the coordinates for the upper-left corner of the image, regardless of the current [](sketch_image_mode).

Setting the color of a single pixel with `py5.set_pixels(x, y)` is easy, but not as fast as putting the data directly into [](sketch_pixels). The equivalent statement to `py5.set_pixels(x, y, 0)` using [](sketch_pixels) is `py5.pixels[y*py5.width+x] = 0`. See the reference for [](sketch_pixels) for more information.
