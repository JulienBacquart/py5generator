mode: int - kind of noise to generate, either PERLIN_NOISE or SIMPLEX_NOISE

@@ description
Sets the kind of noise that the :doc:`noise` function will generate. This can be either Perlin Noise or Simplex Noise. By default, py5 will generate noise using the Simplex Noise algorithm.

Perlin Noise can be generated in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions and Simplex Noise can be generated in 2, 3, or 4 dimensions.

Py5's noise functionality is provided by the Python noise library. The noise library provides more advanced features than what is documented here. To use the more advanced features, import that library directly.
