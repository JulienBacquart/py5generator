@@ description
Sets the current font that will be drawn with the :doc:`py5graphics_text` function. Fonts must be created for py5 with :doc:`create_font` or loaded with :doc:`load_font` before they can be used. The font set through ``text_font()`` will be used in all subsequent calls to the :doc:`py5graphics_text` function. If no ``size`` parameter is specified, the font size defaults to the original size (the size in which it was created with :doc:`create_font_file`) overriding any previous calls to ``text_font()`` or :doc:`py5graphics_text_size`.

When fonts are rendered as an image texture (as is the case with the ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` renderers as well as with :doc:`load_font` and vlw files), you should create fonts at the sizes that will be used most commonly. Using ``text_font()`` without the size parameter will result in the cleanest type.

This method is the same as :doc:`text_font` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`text_font`.
