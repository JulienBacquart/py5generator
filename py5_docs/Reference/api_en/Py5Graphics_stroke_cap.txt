stroke_cap(cap: int, /) -> None

cap: int - either SQUARE, PROJECT, or ROUND

@@ description
Sets the style for rendering line endings. These ends are either squared, extended, or rounded, each of which specified with the corresponding parameters: ``SQUARE``, ``PROJECT``, and ``ROUND``. The default cap is ``ROUND``.

To make :doc:`py5graphics_point` appear square, use ``stroke_cap(PROJECT)``. Using ``stroke_cap(SQUARE)`` (no cap) causes points to become invisible.

This method is the same as :doc:`sketch_stroke_cap` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`sketch_stroke_cap`.
