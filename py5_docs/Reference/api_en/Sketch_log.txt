@@ description
Calculates the natural logarithm (the base-e logarithm) of a number. This function expects the ``n`` parameter to be a value greater than 0.0. This function is the compliment to :doc:`sketch_exp`.

This function makes a call to the numpy ``log()`` function. If the ``n`` parameter is less than or equal to 0.0, you will see a ``RuntimeWarning`` and the returned result will be numpy's Not-a-Number value, ``np.nan``.

@@ example
def setup():
  i = 12
  py5.println(py5.log(i))
  py5.println(log10(i))

  j = -5
  py5.println(py5.log(j))

# Calculates the base-10 logarithm of a number
# use this if you don't want to use numpy's log10 function
def log10(x):
    return (py5.log(x) / py5.log(10))
