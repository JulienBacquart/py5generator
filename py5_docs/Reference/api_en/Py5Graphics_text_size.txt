@@ description
Sets the current font size. This size will be used in all subsequent calls to the [](py5graphics_text) function. Font size is measured in units of pixels.

This method is the same as [](sketch_text_size) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_text_size).
