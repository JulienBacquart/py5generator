size: float - the size of the letters in units of pixels

@@ description
Sets the current font size. This size will be used in all subsequent calls to the :doc:`py5graphics_text` function. Font size is measured in units of pixels.

This method is the same as :doc:`text_size` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`text_size`.
