angle: float - angle of rotation specified in radians

@@ description
Rotates around the x-axis the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from ``0`` to ``TWO_PI``) or converted from degrees to radians with the :doc:`radians` function. Coordinates are always rotated around their relative position to the origin. Positive numbers rotate in a clockwise direction and negative numbers rotate in a counterclockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``rotate_x(PI/2)`` and then ``rotate_x(PI/2)`` is the same as ``rotate_x(PI)``. If ``rotate_x()`` is run within the ``draw()``, the transformation is reset when the loop begins again. This function requires using ``P3D`` as a third parameter to :doc:`size` as shown in the example.

This method is the same as :doc:`rotate_x` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`rotate_x`.
