@@ description
The ``background()`` function sets the color used for the background of the Processing window. The default background is light gray. This function is typically used within ``draw()`` to clear the display window at the beginning of each frame, but it can be used inside ``setup()`` to set the background on the first frame of animation or if the backgound need only be set once.
 
An image can also be used as the background for a sketch, although the image's width and height must match that of the sketch window. Images used with ``background()`` will ignore the current ``tint()`` setting. To resize an image to the size of the sketch window, use image.resize(width, height).
 
It is not possible to use the transparency ``alpha`` parameter with background colors on the main drawing surface. It can only be used along with a ``Py5Graphics`` object and ``create_graphics()``.
