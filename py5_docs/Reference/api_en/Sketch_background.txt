@@ description
The <b>background()</b> function sets the color used for the background of the Processing window. The default background is light gray. This function is typically used within <b>draw()</b> to clear the display window at the beginning of each frame, but it can be used inside <b>setup()</b> to set the background on the first frame of animation or if the backgound need only be set once.
<br /> <br />
An image can also be used as the background for a sketch, although the image's width and height must match that of the sketch window. Images used with <b>background()</b> will ignore the current <b>tint()</b> setting. To resize an image to the size of the sketch window, use image.resize(width, height).
<br /> <br />
It is not possible to use the transparency <b>alpha</b> parameter with background colors on the main drawing surface. It can only be used along with a <b>PGraphics</b> object and <b>createGraphics()</b>.
