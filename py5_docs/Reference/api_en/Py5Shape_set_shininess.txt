@@ description
Sets the amount of gloss a ``Py5Shape`` object's surface has. This is part of the material properties of a ``Py5Shape`` object.

The ``shine`` parameter can be applied to the entire ``Py5Shape`` object or to a single vertex.

This method can only be used for a complete ``Py5Shape`` object, and never within a :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape` pair.
