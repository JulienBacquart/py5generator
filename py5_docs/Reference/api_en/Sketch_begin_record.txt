## description
Opens a new file and all subsequent drawing functions are echoed to this file as well as the display window. The <b>beginRecord()</b> function requires two parameters, the first is the renderer and the second is the file name. This function is always used with <b>endRecord()</b> to stop the recording process and close the file.
<br /><br />
Note that <b>beginRecord()</b> will only pick up any settings that happen after it has been called. For instance, if you call <b>textFont()</b> before <b>beginRecord()</b>, then that font will not be set for the file that you're recording to.
<br /><br />
<b>beginRecord()</b> works only with the PDF and SVG renderers.

## example
import processing.pdf.*;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  beginRecord(PDF, "everything.pdf");
}

void draw() {
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10);
}

void mousePressed() {
  endRecord();
  exit();
}
