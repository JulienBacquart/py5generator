@@ description
Opens a new file and all subsequent drawing functions are echoed to this file as well as the display window. The ``begin_record()`` function requires two parameters, the first is the renderer and the second is the file name. This function is always used with :doc:`end_record` to stop the recording process and close the file.

Note that ``begin_record()`` will only pick up any settings that happen after it has been called. For instance, if you call :doc:`text_font` before ``begin_record()``, then that font will not be set for the file that you're recording to.

``begin_record()`` works only with the ``PDF`` and ``SVG`` renderers.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.size(400, 400)
    py5.begin_record(py5.PDF, "everything.pdf")


def draw():
    py5.ellipse(py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y, 10, 10)


def mouse_pressed():
    py5.end_record()
    py5.exit_sketch()
