@@ description
Opens a new file and all subsequent drawing functions are echoed to this file as well as the display window. The ``begin_record()`` function requires two parameters, the first is the renderer and the second is the file name. This function is always used with ``end_record()`` to stop the recording process and close the file.

Note that ``begin_record()`` will only pick up any settings that happen after it has been called. For instance, if you call ``text_font()`` before ``begin_record()``, then that font will not be set for the file that you're recording to.

``begin_record()`` works only with the PDF and SVG renderers.

@@ example
import processing.pdf.*

void setup() {
  size(400, 400)
  begin_record(PDF, "everything.pdf")
}

void draw() {
  ellipse(mouse_x, mouse_y, 10, 10)
}

void mouse_pressed() {
  end_record()
  exit()
}
