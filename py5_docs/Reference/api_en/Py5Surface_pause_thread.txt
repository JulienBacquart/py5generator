@@ description
Pause a running Sketch. The Sketch window will be static and unresponsive. You can resume the Sketch with :doc:`py5surface_resume_thread`.

The :doc:`frame_count` will not increment while the Sketch is paused.

Pausing a Sketch is not the same as stopping a Sketch, so this method will not change the results of :doc:`py5surface_is_stopped`.

@@ example
def draw():
    py5.rect(py5.random(py5.width), py5.random(py5.height), 10, 10)
    print(py5.frame_count)

py5.run_sketch(block=False)
surface = py5.get_surface()

# pause the sketch.
surface.pause_thread()
# the sketch is no longer running and there is no output

# after waiting a bit, resume the sketch
surface.resume_thread()
