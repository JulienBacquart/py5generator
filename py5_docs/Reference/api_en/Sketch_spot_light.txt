@@ description
Adds a spot light. Lights need to be included in the ``draw()`` to remain persistent in a looping program. Placing them in the ``setup()`` of a looping program will cause them to only have an effect the first time through the loop. The ``v1``, ``v2``, and ``v3`` parameters are interpreted as either RGB or HSB values, depending on the current color mode. The ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` parameters specify the position of the light and ``nx``, ``ny``, ``nz`` specify the direction of light. The ``angle`` parameter affects angle of the spotlight cone, while ``concentration`` sets the bias of light focusing toward the center of that cone.
