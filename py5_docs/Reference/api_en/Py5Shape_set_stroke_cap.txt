set_stroke_cap(cap: int, /) -> None

cap: int - either SQUARE, PROJECT, or ROUND

@@ description
Sets the style for rendering line endings in a ``Py5Shape`` object. These ends are either squared, extended, or rounded, each of which specified with the corresponding parameters: ``SQUARE``, ``PROJECT``, and ``ROUND``. The default cap is ``ROUND``.

This method differs from :doc:`py5shape_stroke_cap` in that it is only to be used outside the :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape` methods.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_set_stroke_cap_0.png

def setup():
    s = py5.create_shape()
    s.begin_shape()
    s.stroke_weight(12.0)
    s.vertex(20, 0)
    s.vertex(80, 0)
    s.end_shape()

    py5.shape(s, 0, 30)
    s.set_stroke_cap(py5.SQUARE)
    py5.shape(s, 0, 50)
    s.set_stroke_cap(py5.PROJECT)
    py5.shape(s, 0, 70)
