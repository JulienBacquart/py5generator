@@ description
Create an animated GIF using a running Sketch.

You have two choices for how to specify which frames should be included in the animated GIF. The first choice is to use the `count` keyword argument to include a specific number of frames. Optionally, the `period` keyword argument can be used with `count` to introduce a fixed time delay between captured frames. The second choice is to use the `frame_numbers` keyword argument to pass a list of frame numbers. A frame will be included when [](sketch_frame_count) is in the list passed to `frame_numbers`. For this feature, frame number 0 is after `setup()` is complete and frame number 1 is after the first call to `draw()`. If the smallest number passed to `frame_numbers` is greater than the current [](sketch_frame_count), this function will throw an exception.

By default this function will return right away and construct the animated gif in the background while the Sketch is running. The completed gif will be saved to the location specified by the `filename` parameter when it is ready. Set the `block` parameter to `True` to instruct the method to not return until the gif construction is complete. This blocking feature is not available on OSX when the Sketch is executed through an IPython kernel. If the Sketch terminates prematurely, no gif will be created.

By default the Sketch will be the currently running Sketch, as returned by [](py5functions_get_current_sketch). Use the `sketch` parameter to specify a different running Sketch, such as a Sketch created using Class mode.

If your Sketch has a `post_draw()` method, use the `hook_post_draw` parameter to make this function run after `post_draw()` instead of `draw()`. This is important when using Processing libraries that support `post_draw()` such as Camera3D or ColorBlindness.

import py5_tools

py5.run_sketch()
# create a 10 frame animated GIF saved to '/tmp/animated.gif'
py5_tools.animated_gif('/tmp/animated.gif', count=10, period=1, duration=0.5)
