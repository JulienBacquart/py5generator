@@ variables
count: int - number of Sketch snapshots to create
duration: float - time in seconds between frames in the GIF
filename: str - filename of GIF to create
loop: int = 0 - number of times for the GIF to loop (default of 0 loops indefinitely)
optimize: bool = True - optimize GIF palette
period: float - time in seconds between Sketch snapshots
sketch: Sketch = None - running Sketch

@@ description
Create an animated GIF using a running Sketch.

By default the Sketch will be the currently running Sketch, as returned by :doc:`get_current_sketch`. Use the ``sketch`` parameter to specify a different running Sketch, such as a Sketch created using Class mode.

@@ example
import py5_tools

py5.run_sketch()
# create a 10 frame animated GIF saved to '/tmp/animated.gif'
py5_tools.animated_gif('/tmp/animated.gif', 10, 1, 0.5)
