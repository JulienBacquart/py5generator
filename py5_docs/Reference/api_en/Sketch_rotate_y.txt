@@ description
Rotates around the y-axis the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from 0 to TWO_PI) or converted from degrees to radians with the ``radians()`` function. Coordinates are always rotated around their relative position to the origin. Positive numbers rotate in a clockwise direction and negative numbers rotate in a counterclockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``rotate_y(PI/2)`` and then ``rotate_y(PI/2)`` is the same as ``rotate_y(PI)``. If ``rotate_y()`` is run within the ``draw()``, the transformation is reset when the loop begins again. This function requires using P3D as a third parameter to ``size()`` as shown in the example above.

image = rotateY_0.png

size(100, 100, P3D)
translate(width/2, height/2)
rotate_y(PI/3.0)
rect(-26, -26, 52, 52)
