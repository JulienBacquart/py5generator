degrees: float - degree value to convert to radians

@@ description
Converts a degree measurement to its corresponding value in radians. Radians and degrees are two ways of measuring the same thing. There are 360 degrees in a circle and ``2*PI`` radians in a circle. For example, ``90Â° = PI/2 = 1.5707964``. All trigonometric functions in py5 require their parameters to be specified in radians.

This function makes a call to the numpy ``radians()`` function.

@@ example
def setup():
    deg = 45
    rad = py5.radians(deg)
    # prints "45 degrees is 0.7854 radians"
    print(round(deg, 5), 'degrees is', round(rad, 5), 'radians')
