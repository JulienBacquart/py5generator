radians: Union[float, npt.ArrayLike] - radian value to convert to degrees

@@ description
Converts a radian measurement to its corresponding value in degrees. Radians and degrees are two ways of measuring the same thing. There are 360 degrees in a circle and ``2*PI`` radians in a circle. For example, ``90Â° = PI/2 = 1.5707964``. All trigonometric functions in py5 require their parameters to be specified in radians.

This function makes a call to the numpy ``degrees()`` function.

@@ example
def setup():
    rad = py5.PI/4
    deg = py5.degrees(rad)
    # prints "0.7854 radians is 45.0 degrees"
    py5.println(round(rad, 5), 'radians is', round(deg, 5), 'degrees')
