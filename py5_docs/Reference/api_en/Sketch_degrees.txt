## description
Converts a radian measurement to its corresponding value in degrees. Radians and degrees are two ways of measuring the same thing. There are 360 degrees in a circle and 2*PI radians in a circle. For example, 90&deg; = PI/2 = 1.5707964. All trigonometric functions in Processing require their parameters to be specified in radians.

## example
float rad = PI/4;
float deg = degrees(rad);
println(rad + " radians is " + deg + " degrees");
