@@ description
Adds a point light. Lights need to be included in the ``draw()`` to remain persistent in a looping program. Placing them in the ``setup()`` of a looping program will cause them to only have an effect the first time through the loop. The ``v1``, ``v2``, and ``v3`` parameters are interpreted as either RGB or HSB values, depending on the current color mode. The ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` parameters set the position of the light.

This method is the same as :doc:`point_light` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`point_light`.
