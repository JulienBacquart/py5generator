@@ description
Gets the stroke color used for lines and points in a `Py5Shape` object. This method can get the stroke assigned to each vertex, but most likely the value will be the same for all vertices.

This method can only be used for a complete `Py5Shape` object, and never within a [](py5shape_begin_shape) and [](py5shape_end_shape) pair.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_get_stroke_0.png

def setup():
    py5.stroke_weight(4)
    py5.stroke(200, 50, 50)
    s = py5.create_shape(py5.RECT, 20, 20, 60, 60)
    py5.shape(s)

    stroke = s.get_stroke(0)
    py5.println(py5.red(stroke), py5.green(stroke), py5.blue(stroke)) # 200, 50, 50
