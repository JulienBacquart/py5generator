@@ description
Loads a shader into the PShader object. The shader file must be loaded in the sketch's "data" folder/directory to load correctly. Shaders are compatible with the P2D and P3D renderers, but not with the default renderer.

Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.

If the file is not available or an error occurs, ``None`` will be returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt the program, however the null value may cause a NullPointerException if your code does not check whether the value returned is null.

def setup():
    global blur
    size(640, 360, P2D)
    # shaders files must be in the "data" folder to load correctly
    blur = load_shader("blur.glsl")
    stroke(0, 102, 153)
    rect_mode(CENTER)


def draw():
    apply_filter(blur)
    rect(mouse_x-75, mouse_y, 150, 150)
    ellipse(mouse_x+75, mouse_y, 150, 150)
