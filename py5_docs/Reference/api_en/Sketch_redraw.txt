redraw() -> None

@@ description
Executes the code within ``draw()`` one time. This functions allows the program to update the display window only when necessary, for example when an event registered by ``mouse_pressed()`` or ``key_pressed()`` occurs. 

In structuring a program, it only makes sense to call ``redraw()`` within events such as ``mouse_pressed()``. This is because ``redraw()`` does not run ``draw()`` immediately (it only sets a flag that indicates an update is needed). 

The ``redraw()`` function does not work properly when called inside ``draw()``. To enable/disable animations, use ``loop()`` and ``no_loop()``.

@@ example
x = 0


def setup():
    py5.size(200, 200)
    py5.no_loop()


def draw():
    py5.background(204)
    py5.line(x, 0, x, py5.height)


def mouse_pressed():
    x += 1
    py5.redraw()
