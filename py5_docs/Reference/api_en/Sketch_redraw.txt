@@ description
Executes the code within ``draw()`` one time. This functions allows the program to update the display window only when necessary, for example when an event registered by ``mouse_pressed()`` or ``key_pressed()`` occurs. 

In structuring a program, it only makes sense to call ``redraw()`` within events such as ``mouse_pressed()``. This is because ``redraw()`` does not run ``draw()`` immediately (it only sets a flag that indicates an update is needed). 

The ``redraw()`` function does not work properly when called inside ``draw()``. To enable/disable animations, use ``loop()`` and ``no_loop()``.

@@ example
float x = 0

void setup() {
  size(200, 200)
  noLoop()
}

void draw() {
  background(204)
  line(x, 0, x, height) 
}

void mousePressed() {
  x += 1
  redraw()
}
