get_children() -> List[Py5Shape]

@@ description
Get the children of a ``Py5Shape`` object as a list of ``Py5Shape`` objects. When Processing loads shape objects, it may create a hierarchy of ``Py5Shape`` objects, depending on the organization of the source data file. This method will retrieve the list of Py5Shapes that are the child objects to a given object.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_get_children_0.png

def setup():
    us_map = py5.load_shape("us_map.svg")
    for child in us_map.get_children():
        py5.println(child.get_name())

    py5.background(192)
    py5.scale(0.1)
    py5.translate(25, 225)
    py5.shape(us_map, 0, 0)
