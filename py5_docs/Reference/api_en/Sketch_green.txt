@@ description
Extracts the green value from a color, scaled to match current ``color_mode()``. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an int value.

The ``green()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit shifting. When working in ``color_mode(RGB, 255)``, you can acheive the same results as ``green()`` but with greater speed by using the right shift operator (``>>``) with a bit mask. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the green value of the color value ``c``:

``g1 = green(c)  # simpler, but slower to calculate
g2 = c >> 8 & 0xFF  # very fast to calculate``

@@ example
image = Sketch_green_0.png

c = color(20, 75, 200)  # define color 'c'
fill(c)  # use color variable 'c' as fill color
rect(15, 20, 35, 60)  # draw left rectangle

green_value = green(c)  # get green in 'c'
print(green_value)  # print "75.0"
fill(0, green_value, 0)  # use 'green_value' in new fill
rect(50, 20, 35, 60)  # draw right rectangle
