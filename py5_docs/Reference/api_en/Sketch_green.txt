@@ description
Extracts the green value from a color, scaled to match current ``color_mode()``. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an int value.

The ``green()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit shifting. When working in ``color_mode(rgb, 255)``, you can acheive the same results as ``green()`` but with greater speed by using the right shift operator (``>>``) with a bit mask. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the green value of the color value ``c``:

``float g1 = green(c);  # _simpler, but slower to calculate
float g2 = c >> 8 & 0x_ff;  # _very fast to calculate``

@@ example
image = green_.png

color c = color(20, 75, 200)  fill(c)  rect(15, 20, 35, 60)  
float green_value = green(c)  print(green_value)  fill(0, green_value, 0)  rect(50, 20, 35, 60)
