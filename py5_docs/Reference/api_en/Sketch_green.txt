@@ description
Extracts the green value from a color, scaled to match current ``color_mode()``. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an int value.

The ``green()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit shifting. When working in ``color_mode(rgb, 255)``, you can acheive the same results as ``green()`` but with greater speed by using the right shift operator (``>>``) with a bit mask. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the green value of the color value ``c``:

``float g1 = green(c);  # _simpler, but slower to calculate
float g2 = c >> 8 & 0x_ff;  # _very fast to calculate``

@@ example
image = green_.png

color c = color(20, 75, 200)  # Define color 'c'
fill(c)  # Use color variable 'c' as fill color
rect(15, 20, 35, 60)  # Draw left rectangle

float greenValue = green(c)  # Get green in 'c'
print(greenValue)  # Print "75.0"
fill(0, greenValue, 0)  # Use 'greenValue' in new fill
rect(50, 20, 35, 60)  # Draw right rectangle
