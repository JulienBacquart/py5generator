no_fill() -> None

@@ description
Disables the ``Py5Shape`` object's filling geometry. If both :doc:`py5shape_no_stroke` and ``no_fill()`` are called, nothing will be drawn to the screen.

This method can only be used within a :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape` pair.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_no_fill_0.png

def setup():
    s = py5.create_shape()
    s.begin_shape()
    s.no_fill()
    s.vertex(20, 80)
    s.vertex(50, 20)
    s.vertex(80, 80)
    s.end_shape(py5.CLOSE)

    py5.shape(s)
