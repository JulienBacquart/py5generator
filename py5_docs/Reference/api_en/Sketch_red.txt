@@ description
Extracts the red value from a color, scaled to match current :doc:`color_mode`.

The ``red()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit shifting. When working in ``color_mode(RGB, 255)``, you can achieve the same results as ``red()`` but with greater speed by using the right shift operator (``>>``) with a bit mask. For example, ``red(c)`` and ``c >> 16 & 0xFF`` both extract the red value from a color variable ``c`` but the later is faster.

@@ example
image = Sketch_red_0.png

def setup():
    c = py5.color(255, 204, 0)  # define color 'c'
    py5.fill(c)  # use color variable 'c' as fill color
    py5.rect(15, 20, 35, 60)  # draw left rectangle
    
    red_value = py5.red(c)  # get red in 'c'
    py5.println(red_value)  # print "255.0"
    py5.fill(red_value, 0, 0)  # use 'red_value' in new fill
    py5.rect(50, 20, 35, 60)  # draw right rectangle
