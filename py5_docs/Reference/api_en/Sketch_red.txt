@@ description
Extracts the red value from a color, scaled to match current ``color_mode()``. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an int value.

The ``red()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit shifting. When working in ``color_mode(rgb, 255)``, you can acheive the same results as ``red()`` but with greater speed by using the right shift operator (``>>``) with a bit mask. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the red value of the color value ``c``:

``float r1 = red(c);  # _simpler, but slower to calculate
float r2 = c >> 16 & 0x_ff;  # _very fast to calculate``

@@ example
image = red_.png

color c = color(255, 204, 0)  fill(c)  rect(15, 20, 35, 60)  	
float red_value = red(c)  print(red_value)  fill(red_value, 0, 0)  rect(50, 20, 35, 60)
