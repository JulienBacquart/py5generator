texture_wrap(wrap: int, /) -> None

wrap: int - Either CLAMP (default) or REPEAT

@@ description
Defines if textures repeat or draw once within a texture map. The two parameters are ``CLAMP`` (the default behavior) and ``REPEAT``. This function only works with the ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` renderers.

This method is the same as :doc:`sketch_texture_wrap` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`sketch_texture_wrap`.
