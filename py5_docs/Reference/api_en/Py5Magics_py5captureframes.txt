Capture frames from the currently running sketch.

Use the -w argument to wait before starting.

The below example will capture 10 frames from the currently running sketch. The frames will be recorded 1 second apart after waiting 3 seconds. The results are returned in a Python list of PIL Image objects and assigned to the variable `frames`.

```
    frames = %py5captureframes 10 -w 3 -p 1
```
