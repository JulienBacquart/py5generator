select_input(prompt: str, callback: Callable, default_file: str = None) -> None

@@ variables
callback: Callable - callback function after selection is made
default_file: str = None - default output file
prompt: str - text prompt for select dialog box

@@ description
Open a file chooser dialog to select a file for input. After the selection is made, the selected File will be passed to the ``callback`` function. If the dialog is closed or canceled, ``None`` will be sent to the function, so that the program is not waiting for additional input. The callback is necessary because of how threading works.

@@ example
def file_selected(selection):
    if selection is None:
        py5.println("Window was closed or the user hit cancel.")
    else:
        py5.println("User selected " + selection)


def setup():
    py5.select_input("Select a file to process:", file_selected)
