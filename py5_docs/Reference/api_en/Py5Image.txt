@@ description
Datatype for storing images. Processing can display ``.gif``, ``.jpg``, ``.tga``, and ``.png`` images. Images may be displayed in 2D and 3D space. Before an image is used, it must be loaded with the ``load_image()`` function. The ``Py5Image`` class contains fields for the ``width`` and ``height`` of the image, as well as an array called ``pixels[]`` that contains the values for every pixel in the image. The methods described below allow easy access to the image's pixels and alpha channel and simplify the process of compositing.

Before using the ``pixels[]`` array, be sure to use the ``load_pixels()`` method on the image to make sure that the pixel data is properly loaded.

To create a new image, use the ``create_image()`` function. Do not use the syntax ``new Py5Image()``.

@@ example
image = Py5Image_0.png

def setup():
    global photo
    photo = py5.load_image("laDefense.jpg")


def draw():
    py5.image(photo, 0, 0)
