@@ description
Get the Py5Graphics drawing surface as a PIL Image object. The returned PIL Image object can include the entirety of the Py5Graphics drawing surface or a rectangular subsection. Use the `x`, `y`, `h`, and `w` parameters to specify the bounds of a rectangular subsection.

This method is the same as [](sketch_to_pil) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object.
