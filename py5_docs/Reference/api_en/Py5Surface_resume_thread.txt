@@ description
Resume a paused Sketch. The Sketch window will resume operating as it did before :doc:`py5surface_pause_thread` was called.

The :doc:`frame_count` will continue incrementing after the Sketch is resumed.

@@ example
def draw():
    py5.rect(py5.random(py5.width), py5.random(py5.height), 10, 10)
    print(py5.frame_count)

py5.run_sketch()
surface = py5.get_surface()

# pause the sketch.
surface.pause_thread()
# the sketch is no longer running and there is no output

# after waiting a bit, resume the sketch
surface.resume_thread()
