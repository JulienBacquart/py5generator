alpha(rgb: int, /) -> float

rgb: int - any value of the color datatype

@@ description
Extracts the alpha value from a color, scaled to match current ``color_mode()``. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an int value.

The ``alpha()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit shifting. When working in ``color_mode(RGB, 255)``, you can achieve the same results as ``alpha()`` but with greater speed by using the right shift operator (``>>``) with a bit mask. For example, ``alpha(c)`` and ``c >> 24 & 0xFF`` both extract the alpha value from a color variable ``c`` but the later is faster.

def setup():
    py5.no_stroke()
    c = py5.color(0, 126, 255, 102)
    py5.fill(c)
    py5.rect(15, 15, 35, 70)
    value = py5.alpha(c)  # sets 'value' to 102
    py5.fill(value)
    py5.rect(50, 15, 35, 70)
