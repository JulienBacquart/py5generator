@@ description
System variable that stores the height of the Py5Graphics drawing surface. This value is set when creating the ``Py5Graphics`` object with the :doc:`create_graphics` method. For example, ``create_graphics(320, 240)`` sets the ``height`` variable to the value 240.

This field is the same as :doc:`height` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`height`.
