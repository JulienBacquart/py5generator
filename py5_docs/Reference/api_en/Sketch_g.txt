@@ description
The [](py5graphics) object used by the Sketch. Internally, all of Processing's drawing functionality comes from interaction with PGraphics objects, and this will provide direct access to the PGraphics object used by the Sketch.

Use of `g` was deprecated in version 0.9.1 and was removed in version 0.9.2. Please use [](sketch_get_graphics) instead.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.g.rect(10, 10, 50, 50)
    py5.println(type(py5.g))
