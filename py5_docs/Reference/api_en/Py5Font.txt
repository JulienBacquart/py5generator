@@ description
Py5Font is the font class for py5. To create a font to use with py5, use :doc:`create_font_file`. This will create a font in the format py5 requires. Py5 displays fonts using the .vlw font format, which uses images for each letter, rather than defining them through vector data. The ``load_font()`` function constructs a new font and ``text_font()`` makes a font active. The ``list()`` method creates a list of the fonts installed on the computer, which is useful information to use with the ``create_font()`` function for dynamically converting fonts into a format to use with py5.

To create a new font dynamically, use the ``create_font()`` function. Do not use the syntax ``Py5Font()``.

image = Py5Font_0.png

def setup():
    # the font must be located in the sketch's
    # "data" directory to load successfully
    font = py5.create_font("FreeSans.ttf", 32)
    py5.text_font(font)
    py5.text("word", 10, 50)
