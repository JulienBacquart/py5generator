@@ description
Evaluates the Bezier at point t for points a, b, c, d. The parameter t varies between 0 and 1, a and d are points on the curve, and b and c are the control points. This can be done once with the x coordinates and a second time with the y coordinates to get the location of a bezier curve at t.

@@ example
image = Sketch_bezier_point_0.png

no_fill()
bezier(85, 20, 10, 10, 90, 90, 15, 80)
fill(255)
steps = 10
for i in range(0, steps + 1):
    t = i / float(steps)
    x = bezier_point(85, 10, 90, 15, t)
    y = bezier_point(20, 10, 90, 80, t)
    ellipse(x, y, 5, 5)
