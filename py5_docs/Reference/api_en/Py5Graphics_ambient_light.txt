@@ description
Adds an ambient light. Ambient light doesn't come from a specific direction, the rays of light have bounced around so much that objects are evenly lit from all sides. Ambient lights are almost always used in combination with other types of lights. The `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` parameters are interpreted as either `RGB` or `HSB` values, depending on the current color mode.

This method is the same as [](sketch_ambient_light) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_ambient_light).
