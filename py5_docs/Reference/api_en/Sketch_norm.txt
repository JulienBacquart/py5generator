## description
Normalizes a number from another range into a value between 0 and 1. Identical to <b>map(value, low, high, 0, 1)</b>.<br />
<br />
Numbers outside of the range are not clamped to 0 and 1, because out-of-range values are often intentional and useful.  (See the second example above.)

## example
float value = 20;
float n = norm(value, 0, 50);
println(n);  // Prints "0.4"

## example
float value = -10;
float n = norm(value, 0, 100);
println(n);  // Prints "-0.1"
