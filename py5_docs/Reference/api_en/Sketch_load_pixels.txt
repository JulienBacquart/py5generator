@@ description
Loads the pixel data of the current display window into the ``pixels[]`` array. This function must always be called before reading from or writing to ``pixels[]``. Subsequent changes to the display window will not be reflected in ``pixels`` until ``load_pixels()`` is called again.

@@ example
image = loadPixels_.png

int halfImage = width*height/2
PImage myImage = loadImage("apples.jpg")
image(myImage, 0, 0)

loadPixels()
for (int i = 0 i < halfImage i++) {
  pixels[i+halfImage] = pixels[i]
}
updatePixels()
