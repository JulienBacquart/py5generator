@@ description
Loads the pixel data of the current display window into the ``pixels[]`` array. This function must always be called before reading from or writing to ``pixels[]``. Subsequent changes to the display window will not be reflected in ``pixels`` until ``load_pixels()`` is called again.

@@ example
image = loadPixels_.png

half_image = width*height/2
my_image = load_image("apples.jpg")
image(my_image, 0, 0)

load_pixels()
for i = range(0, half_image):
    pixels[i+half_image] = pixels[i]

update_pixels()
