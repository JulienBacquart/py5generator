load_pixels() -> None

@@ description
Loads the pixel data of the current display window into the ``pixels[]`` array. This function must always be called before reading from or writing to ``pixels[]``. Subsequent changes to the display window will not be reflected in ``pixels`` until ``load_pixels()`` is called again.

@@ example
image = Sketch_load_pixels_0.png

half_image = py5.width*py5.height//2
my_image = py5.load_image("apples.jpg")
py5.image(my_image, 0, 0)

py5.load_pixels()
for i in range(0, half_image):
    py5.pixels[i+half_image] = py5.pixels[i]

py5.update_pixels()
