@@ description
Get the ambient reflectance setting for one of a ``Py5Shape`` object's vertices. This setting is combined with the ambient light component of the environment. Use :doc:`py5shape_set_ambient` to change the setting.

This method can only be used for a complete ``Py5Shape`` object, and never within a :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape` pair.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_get_ambient_0.png

def settings():
    py5.size(100, 100, py5.P3D)


def setup():
    py5.background(0)
    py5.directional_light(153, 153, 153, .5, 0, -1)
    py5.ambient(255, 255, 0)
    py5.ambient_light(50, 50, 50)
    py5.no_stroke()
    s = py5.create_shape(py5.SPHERE, 30)

    py5.shape(s, 50, 50)
    ambient = s.get_ambient(0)
    print(py5.red(ambient), py5.green(ambient), py5.blue(ambient))
