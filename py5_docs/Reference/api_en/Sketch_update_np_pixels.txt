update_np_pixels() -> None

@@ description
Updates the display window with the data in the :doc:`np_pixels` array. Use in conjunction with :doc:`load_np_pixels`. If you're only reading pixels from the array, there's no need to call ``update_np_pixels()`` â€” updating is only necessary to apply changes.

The ``update_np_pixels()`` method is similar to :doc:`update_pixels` in that ``update_np_pixels()`` must be called after modifying :doc:`np_pixels` just as :doc:`update_pixels` must be called after modifying :doc:`pixels`.
