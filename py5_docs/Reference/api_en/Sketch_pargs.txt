@@ description
List of strings passed to the Sketch through the call to :doc:`run_sketch`. Only passing strings is allowed, but you can convert string types to something else to make this more useful.

@@ example
def setup():
    color = eval(py5.pargs[0])
    py5.background(color)

py5.run_sketch(sketch_args=['0xFF0000'])
