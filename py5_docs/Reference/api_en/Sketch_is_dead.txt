@@ description
Boolean value stating if the Sketch has been run and has now stopped. This will be ``True`` after calling :doc:`exit_sketch` or if the Sketch throws an error and stops. This will also be ``True`` after calling :doc:`py5surface`'s :doc:`py5surface_stop_thread` method. Once a Sketch reaches the "dead" state, it cannot be rerun.

After an error or a call to :doc:`py5surface_stop_thread`, the Sketch window will still be open. Call :doc:`exit_sketch` to close the window.
