Confirms if a py5 program is "focused," meaning that it is active and will accept mouse or keyboard input. This variable is ``True`` if it is focused and ``False`` if not.

@@ example
def setup():
    if py5.focused:
        py5.ellipse(25, 25, 50, 50)
    else:
        py5.line(0, 0, 100, 100)
        py5.line(100, 0, 0, 100)
