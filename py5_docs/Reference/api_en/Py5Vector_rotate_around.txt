rotate_around(angle: float, v: Py5Vector3D) -> Py5Vector3D

@@ variables
angle: float - angle of rotation, measured in radians
v: Py5Vector3D - 3D vector to rotate vector around

@@ description
Rotate around an arbitrary 3D vector. This method is only applicable to 3D vectors. Use the ``angle`` parameter to specify the rotation angle and the ``v`` parameter to specify the vector to rotate around. The ``v`` vector does not need to be aligned to any axis or normalized, but it must be a 3D vector and it cannot be a vector of zeros.

The vector's rotation will follow the right-hand rule. Using your right hand, point your thumb in the direction of the vector to rotate around. Your fingers will curl in the direction of rotation when the ``angle`` parameter is positive.
