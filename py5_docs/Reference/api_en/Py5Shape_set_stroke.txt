## description
The <b>setStroke()</b> method defines the outline color of a <b>PShape</b>. This method is used after shapes are created or when a shape is defined explicitly (e.g. <b>createShape(RECT, 20, 20, 80, 80)</b>) as shown in the above example. When a shape is created with <b>beginShape()</b> and <b>endShape()</b>, its attributes may be changed with <b>fill()</b> and <b>stroke()</b> within <b>beginShape()</b> and <b>endShape()</b>. However, after the shape is created, only the <b>setStroke()</b> method can define a new stroke value for the <b>PShape</b>.

## example
PShape circle;

void setup() {  
  size(640, 360, P2D);
  circle = createShape(ELLIPSE, 0, 0, 200, 200);
  circle.setStroke(color(255));  
}

void draw() {
  background(51);
  circle.setFill(color(random(255)));
  translate(mouseX, mouseY);
  shape(circle);
}
