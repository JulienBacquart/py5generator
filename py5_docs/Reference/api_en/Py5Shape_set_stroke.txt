@@ description
The ``set_stroke()`` method defines the outline color of a ``Py5Shape``. This method is used after shapes are created or when a shape is defined explicitly (e.g. ``create_shape(RECT, 20, 20, 80, 80)``) as shown in the above example. When a shape is created with ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()``, its attributes may be changed with ``fill()`` and ``stroke()`` within ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()``. However, after the shape is created, only the ``set_stroke()`` method can define a new stroke value for the ``Py5Shape``.

    global c
    c = py5.create_shape(py5.ELLIPSE, 0, 0, 200, 200)
    c.set_stroke(py5.color(255))


def draw():
    py5.background(51)
    c.set_fill(py5.color(py5.random(255)))
