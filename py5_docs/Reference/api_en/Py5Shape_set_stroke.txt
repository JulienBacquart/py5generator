@@ description
The ``set_stroke()`` method defines the outline color of a ``p_shape``. This method is used after shapes are created or when a shape is defined explicitly (e.g. ``create_shape(rect, 20, 20, 80, 80)``) as shown in the above example. When a shape is created with ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()``, its attributes may be changed with ``fill()`` and ``stroke()`` within ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()``. However, after the shape is created, only the ``set_stroke()`` method can define a new stroke value for the ``p_shape``.

@@ example
PShape circle;

void setup() {  
  size(640, 360, P2D);
  circle = createShape(ELLIPSE, 0, 0, 200, 200);
  circle.setStroke(color(255));  
}

void draw() {
  background(51);
  circle.setFill(color(random(255)));
  translate(mouseX, mouseY);
  shape(circle);
}
