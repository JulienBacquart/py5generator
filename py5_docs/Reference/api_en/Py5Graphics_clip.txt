@@ description
Limits the rendering to the boundaries of a rectangle defined by the parameters. The boundaries are drawn based on the state of the :doc:`py5graphics_image_mode` fuction, either ``CORNER``, ``CORNERS``, or ``CENTER``.

This method is the same as :doc:`clip` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`clip`.
