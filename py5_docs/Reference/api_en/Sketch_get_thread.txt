@@ description
Get the Python Thread associated with the given thread name. Accessing the Python Thread is necessary to ``join()`` with the thread, as shown in the example. This method will return ``None`` if the named thread does not exist or the thread is no longer running. You can get the list of all currently running threads with :doc:`sketch_list_threads`.
