@@ description
Pickle a Python object to a file. If `filename` is not an absolute path, it will be saved relative to the current working directory ([](sketch_sketch_path)). The saved file can be reloaded with [](sketch_load_pickle).

Object "pickling" is a method for serializing objects and saving them to a file for later retrieval. The recreated objects will be clones of the original objects. Not all Python objects can be saved to a Python pickle file. This limitation prevents any py5 object from being pickled.

@@ example
data = dict(mouse_x=[], mouse_y=[])

def setup():
    py5.size(250, 250)
    py5.stroke_weight(10)


def draw():
    data['mouse_x'].append(py5.mouse_x)
    data['mouse_y'].append(py5.mouse_y)
    py5.point(py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y)
    if py5.frame_count == 600:
        py5.save_pickle(data, 'data/mouse_positions.pkl')
