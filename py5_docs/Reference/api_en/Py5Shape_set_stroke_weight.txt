@@ description
Sets the width of the stroke used for lines and points in a ``Py5Shape`` object. All widths are set in units of pixels. Attempting to set this for individual vertices may not work, depending on the renderer used and other factors.

This method differs from :doc:`py5shape_stroke_weight` in that it is only to be used outside the :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape` methods.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_set_stroke_weight_0.png

def setup():
    s = py5.create_shape()
    s.begin_shape()
    s.stroke_weight(1)
    s.vertex(20, 0)
    s.vertex(80, 0)
    s.end_shape()

    py5.shape(s, 0, 20)
    s.set_stroke_weight(4)
    py5.shape(s, 0, 40)
    s.set_stroke_weight(10)
    py5.shape(s, 0, 70)
