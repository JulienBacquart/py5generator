strokes: npt.NDArray[np.int32] - array of stroke colors

@@ description
Set the stroke color for each of the individual vertices of a `Py5Shape`. The length of the passed `strokes` array must equal the number of vertices in the shape. This method exists to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling [](py5shape_set_fill) in a loop.

This method can only be used after shapes are created or when a shape is defined explicitly. Do not use this method between the calls to [](py5shape_begin_shape) and [](py5shape_end_shape).
