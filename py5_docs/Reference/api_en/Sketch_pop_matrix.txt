pop_matrix() -> None

@@ description
Pops the current transformation matrix off the matrix stack. Understanding pushing and popping requires understanding the concept of a matrix stack. The ``push_matrix()`` function saves the current coordinate system to the stack and ``pop_matrix()`` restores the prior coordinate system. ``push_matrix()`` and ``pop_matrix()`` are used in conjuction with the other transformation functions and may be embedded to control the scope of the transformations.

@@ example
image = Sketch_pop_matrix_0.png

py5.fill(255)
py5.rect(0, 0, 50, 50)  # white rectangle

py5.push_matrix()
py5.translate(30, 20)
py5.fill(0)
py5.rect(0, 0, 50, 50)  # black rectangle
py5.pop_matrix()

py5.fill(100)
py5.rect(15, 10, 50, 50)  # gray rectangle
