@@ description
Pops the current transformation matrix off the matrix stack. Understanding pushing and popping requires understanding the concept of a matrix stack. The ``push_matrix()`` function saves the current coordinate system to the stack and ``pop_matrix()`` restores the prior coordinate system. ``push_matrix()`` and ``pop_matrix()`` are used in conjuction with the other transformation functions and may be embedded to control the scope of the transformations.

fill(255)
rect(0, 0, 50, 50)  # white rectangle

push_matrix()
translate(30, 20)
fill(0)
rect(0, 0, 50, 50)  # black rectangle
pop_matrix()

fill(100)
rect(15, 10, 50, 50)  # gray rectangle
