angle: float - angle of shear specified in radians

@@ description
Shears a shape around the y-axis the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from ``0`` to ``TWO_PI``) or converted to radians with the :doc:`radians` function. Objects are always sheared around their relative position to the origin and positive numbers shear objects in a clockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``shear_y(PI/2)`` and then ``shear_y(PI/2)`` is the same as ``shear_y(PI)``.
 
Technically, ``shear_y()`` multiplies the current transformation matrix by a rotation matrix. This function can be further controlled by the :doc:`py5graphics_push_matrix` and :doc:`py5graphics_pop_matrix` functions.

This method is the same as :doc:`shear_y` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`shear_y`.
