@@ description
Updates the image with the data in its ``pixels[]`` array. Use in conjunction with ``load_pixels()``. If you're only reading pixels from the array, there's no need to call ``update_pixels()``.

@@ example
image = Py5Image_update_pixels_0.png



def setup():
    global my_image
    global half_image
    size(100, 100)
    half_image = width * height//2
    my_image = load_image("apples.jpg")
    my_image.load_pixels()
    for i in range(0, half_image):
        my_image.pixels[i+half_image] = my_image.pixels[i]

    my_image.update_pixels()


def draw():
    image(my_image, 0, 0)
