@@ description
Quits/stops/exits the program. Programs without a ``draw()`` function stop automatically after the last line has run, but programs with ``draw()`` run continuously until the program is manually stopped or ``exit()`` is run.

Rather than terminating immediately, ``exit()`` will cause the sketch to exit after ``draw()`` has completed (or after ``setup()`` completes if called during the ``setup()`` function).

For Java programmers, this is *not* the same as System.``exit()``. Further, System.``exit()`` should not be used because closing out an application while ``draw()`` is running may cause a crash (particularly with P3D).

def draw():
    line(mouse_x, mouse_y, 50, 50)


def mouse_pressed():
    exit()
