set_path(vcount: int, verts: NDArray[(Any, Any), Float], /) -> None

@@ variables
vcount: int - number of vertices
verts: NDArray[(Any, Any), Float] - array of vertex coordinates

@@ description
Set many vertex points at the same time, using a numpy array. This will be faster and more efficient than repeatedly calling :doc:`py5shape_set_vertex` in a loop. Setting the vertex codes is not supported, so the vertices will be regular vertices and not bezier, quadratic or curve vertices.

The ``vcount`` parameter cannot be larger than the first dimension of the ``verts`` array.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_set_path_0.png

import numpy as np

def setup():
    vertices = 100 * np.random.rand(25, 2)
    s = py5.create_shape()
    s.begin_shape()
    s.no_fill()
    s.set_path(vertices.shape[0], vertices)
    s.end_shape()
    py5.shape(s)
