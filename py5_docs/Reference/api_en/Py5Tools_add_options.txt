options: List[str] - list of desired JVM options

@@ description
Provide JVM options to use when the JVM starts. This is useful to set the JVM memory size, for example.

After the JVM has started, new options cannot be added. This function will throw a ``RuntimeError`` if it is called after the JVM has already started. Use :doc:`is_jvm_running` to first determine if the JVM is running.
