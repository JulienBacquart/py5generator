@@ description
Sets a texture to be applied to a ``Py5Shape`` object's vertex points. The ``texture()`` function must be called between :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape` and before any calls to :doc:`py5shape_vertex`. This method only works with the ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` renderers.

When textures are in use, the fill color is ignored. Instead, use :doc:`py5shape_tint` to specify the color of the texture as it is applied to the shape.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_texture_0.png

def settings():
    py5.size(100, 100, py5.P2D)


def setup():
    img = py5.load_image("tower.jpg")
    s = py5.create_shape()
    s.begin_shape()
    s.texture(img)
    s.vertex(20, 20, 0, 0)
    s.vertex(20, 80, 0, 100)
    s.vertex(80, 80, 100, 100)
    s.vertex(80, 20, 100, 0)
    s.end_shape(py5.CLOSE)

    py5.shape(s)
