@@ description
Sets the spacing between lines of text in units of pixels. This setting will be used in all subsequent calls to the ``text()`` function.  Note, however, that the leading is reset by ``text_size()``. For example, if the leading is set to 20 with ``text_leading(20)``, then if ``text_size(48)`` is run at a later point, the leading will be reset to the default for the text size of 48.

// Text to display. The "&#92;n" is a "new line" character
String lines = "L1&#92;nL2&#92;nL3";
textSize(12);
fill(0);  // Set fill to black

textLeading(10);  // Set leading to 10
text(lines, 10, 25);

textLeading(20);  // Set leading to 20
text(lines, 40, 25);

textLeading(30);  // Set leading to 30
text(lines, 70, 25);
