text_leading(leading: float, /) -> None

@@ variables
leading: float - the size in pixels for spacing between lines

@@ description
Sets the spacing between lines of text in units of pixels. This setting will be used in all subsequent calls to the ``text()`` function.  Note, however, that the leading is reset by ``text_size()``. For example, if the leading is set to 20 with ``text_leading(20)``, then if ``text_size(48)`` is run at a later point, the leading will be reset to the default for the text size of 48.

@@ example

# text to display. the "\n" is a "new line" character
lines = "L1\nL2\nL3"
text_size(12)
fill(0)  # set fill to black

text_leading(10)  # set leading to 10
text(lines, 10, 25)

text_leading(20)  # set leading to 20
text(lines, 40, 25)

text_leading(30)  # set leading to 30
text(lines, 70, 25)
