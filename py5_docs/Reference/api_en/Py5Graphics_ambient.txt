@@ description
Sets the ambient reflectance for shapes drawn to the screen. This is combined with the ambient light component of the environment. The color components set through the parameters define the reflectance. For example in the default color mode, setting `ambient(255, 127, 0)`, would cause all the red light to reflect and half of the green light to reflect. Use in combination with [](py5graphics_emissive), [](py5graphics_specular), and [](py5graphics_shininess) to set the material properties of shapes.

This method is the same as [](sketch_ambient) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_ambient).
