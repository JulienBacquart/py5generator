@@ description
Take a screenshot of a running Sketch.

By default the Sketch will be the currently running Sketch, as returned by :doc:`get_current_sketch`. Use the ``sketch`` parameter to specify a different running Sketch, such as a Sketch created using Class mode.

The returned image is a ``PIL.Image`` object. It can be assigned to a variable or embedded in the notebook.

@@ example
import time
import py5_tools

py5.run_sketch()
# take a screenshot of the running sketch after a two second delay
time.sleep(2)
img = py5_tools.screenshot()
img.save('image.png')
