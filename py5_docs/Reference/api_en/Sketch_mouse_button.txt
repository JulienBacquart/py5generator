@@ description
When a mouse button is pressed, the value of the system variable ``mouse_button`` is set to either ``LEFT``, ``RIGHT``, or ``CENTER``, depending on which button is pressed. (If no button is pressed, ``mouse_button`` may be reset to ``0``. For that reason, it's best to use ``mouse_pressed`` first to test if any button is being pressed, and only then test the value of ``mouse_button``, as shown in the examples above.)

# Click within the image and press
# the left and right mouse buttons to 
# change the value of the rectangle

    fill(255)
  } else {
    fill(126)
