@@ description
Adds a directional light. Directional light comes from one direction: it is stronger when hitting a surface squarely, and weaker if it hits at a gentle angle. After hitting a surface, directional light scatters in all directions. Lights need to be included in the ``draw()`` to remain persistent in a looping program. Placing them in the ``setup()`` of a looping program will cause them to only have an effect the first time through the loop. The ``v1``, ``v2``, and ``v3`` parameters are interpreted as either RGB or HSB values, depending on the current color mode. The ``nx``, ``ny``, and ``nz`` parameters specify the direction the light is facing. For example, setting ``ny`` to -1 will cause the geometry to be lit from below (since the light would be facing directly upward).
