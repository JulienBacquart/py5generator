@@ description
Sets the style for rendering line endings. These ends are either squared, extended, or rounded, each of which specified with the corresponding parameters: SQUARE, PROJECT, and ROUND. The default cap is ROUND.

To make ``point()`` appear square, use ``stroke_cap(PROJECT)``. Using ``stroke_cap(SQUARE)`` (no cap) causes points to become invisible.
