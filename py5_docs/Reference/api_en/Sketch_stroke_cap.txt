@@ description
Sets the style for rendering line endings. These ends are either squared, extended, or rounded, each of which specified with the corresponding parameters: SQUARE, PROJECT, and ROUND. The default cap is ROUND.

To make ``point()`` appear square, use ``stroke_cap(project)``. Using ``stroke_cap(square)`` (no cap) causes points to become invisible.

@@ example

strokeWeight(12.0);
strokeCap(ROUND);
line(20, 30, 80, 30);
strokeCap(SQUARE);
line(20, 50, 80, 50);
strokeCap(PROJECT);
line(20, 70, 80, 70);
