@@ description
System variable that stores the height of the entire screen display. This can be used to run a full-screen program on any display size, but calling :doc:`sketch_full_screen` is usually a better choice.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.size(py5.display_width, py5.display_height)
    py5.line(0, 0, py5.width, py5.height)
