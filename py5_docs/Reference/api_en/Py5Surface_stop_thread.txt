stop_thread() -> bool

@@ description
Stop the animation thread. The Sketch window will remain open but will be static and unresponsive. Use [](py5surface_is_stopped) to determine if a Sketch has been stopped or not.

This method is different from [](py5surface_pause_thread) in that it will irreversably stop the animation. Use [](py5surface_pause_thread) and [](py5surface_resume_thread) if you want to pause and resume a running Sketch.

@@ example
def draw():
    py5.rect(py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y, 10, 10)

py5.run_sketch(block=False)
surface = py5.get_surface()
# this will print False
py5.println(surface.is_stopped())

surface.stop_thread()
# now it will print True
py5.println(surface.is_stopped())
