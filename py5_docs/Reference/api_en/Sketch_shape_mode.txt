shape_mode(mode: int, /) -> None

@@ variables
mode: int - either CORNER, CORNERS, CENTER

@@ description
Modifies the location from which shapes draw. The default mode is ``shape_mode(CORNER)``, which specifies the location to be the upper left corner of the shape and uses the third and fourth parameters of :doc:`shape` to specify the width and height. The syntax ``shape_mode(CORNERS)`` uses the first and second parameters of :doc:`shape` to set the location of one corner and uses the third and fourth parameters to set the opposite corner. The syntax ``shape_mode(CENTER)`` draws the shape from its center point and uses the third and forth parameters of :doc:`shape` to specify the width and height. The parameter must be written in ALL CAPS because Python is a case sensitive language.
