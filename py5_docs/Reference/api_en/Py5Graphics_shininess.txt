@@ description
Sets the amount of gloss in the surface of shapes. Use in combination with :doc:`py5graphics_ambient`, :doc:`py5graphics_specular`, and :doc:`py5graphics_emissive` to set the material properties of shapes.

This method is the same as :doc:`sketch_shininess` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`sketch_shininess`.
