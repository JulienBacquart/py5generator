Sets the amount of gloss in the surface of shapes. Use in combination with [](py5graphics_ambient), [](py5graphics_specular), and [](py5graphics_emissive) to set the material properties of shapes.

This method is the same as [](sketch_shininess) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_shininess).
