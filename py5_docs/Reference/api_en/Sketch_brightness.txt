@@ description
Extracts the brightness value from a color.

This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g. "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online ["All About Colors"](/integrations/colors) Python Ecosystem Integration tutorial for more information.

@@ example
image = Sketch_brightness_0.png

def setup():
    py5.no_stroke()
    py5.color_mode(py5.HSB, 255)
    c = py5.color(0, 126, 255)
    py5.fill(c)
    py5.rect(15, 20, 35, 60)
    value = py5.brightness(c)  # sets 'value' to 255
    py5.fill(value)
    py5.rect(50, 20, 35, 60)
