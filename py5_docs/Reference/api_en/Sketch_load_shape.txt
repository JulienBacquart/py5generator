@@ description
Loads geometry into a variable of type ``Py5Shape``. SVG and OBJ files may be loaded. To load correctly, the file must be located in the data directory of the current sketch. In most cases, ``load_shape()`` should be used inside ``setup()`` because loading shapes inside ``draw()`` will reduce the speed of a sketch.

Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.

If the file is not available or an error occurs, ``null`` will be returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt the program, however the null value may cause a NullPointerException if your code does not check whether the value returned is null.
