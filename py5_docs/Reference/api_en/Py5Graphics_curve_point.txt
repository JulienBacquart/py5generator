@@ description
Evaluates the curve at point `t` for points `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. The parameter `t` may range from 0 (the start of the curve) and 1 (the end of the curve). `a` and `d` are the control points, and `b` and `c` are points on the curve. As seen in the example, this can be used once with the `x` coordinates and a second time with the `y` coordinates to get the location of a curve at `t`.

This method is the same as [](sketch_curve_point) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_curve_point).
