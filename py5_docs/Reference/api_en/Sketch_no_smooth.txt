no_smooth() -> None

@@ description
Draws all geometry and fonts with jagged (aliased) edges and images with hard edges between the pixels when enlarged rather than interpolating pixels.  Note that :doc:`smooth` is active by default, so it is necessary to call ``no_smooth()`` to disable smoothing of geometry, fonts, and images. The ``no_smooth()`` function can only be run once for each sketch and must be called in ``settings()``.

@@ example
def settings():
    py5.size(100, 100, py5.P2D)
    py5.no_smooth()


def setup():
    py5.no_stroke()


def draw():
    py5.background(0)
    py5.ellipse(30, 48, 36, 36)
    py5.ellipse(70, 48, 36, 36)
