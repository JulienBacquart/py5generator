@@ description
Draws all geometry and fonts with jagged (aliased) edges and images with hard edges between the pixels when enlarged rather than interpolating pixels.  Note that ``smooth()`` is active by default, so it is necessary to call ``no_smooth()`` to disable smoothing of geometry, fonts, and images. Since the release of Processing 3.0, the ``no_smooth()`` function can only be run once for each sketch, either at the top of a sketch without a ``setup()``, or after the ``size()`` function when used in a sketch with ``setup()``. See the examples above for both scenarios.

@@ example
size(100, 100)
noSmooth()
noStroke()
background(0)
ellipse(30, 48, 36, 36)
ellipse(70, 48, 36, 36)
