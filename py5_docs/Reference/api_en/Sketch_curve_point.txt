@@ description
Evaluates the curve at point ``t`` for points ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ``d``. The parameter ``t`` may range from 0 (the start of the curve) and 1 (the end of the curve). ``a`` and ``d`` are the control points, and ``b`` and ``c`` are points on the curve. As seen in the example above, this can be used once with the ``x`` coordinates and a second time with the ``y`` coordinates to get the location of a curve at ``t``.
