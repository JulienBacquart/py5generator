@@ description
Sets the current normal vector. Used for drawing three dimensional shapes and surfaces, ``normal()`` specifies a vector perpendicular to a shape's surface which, in turn, determines how lighting affects it. Py5 attempts to automatically assign normals to shapes, but since that's imperfect, this is a better option when you want more control. This function is identical to ``gl_normal3f()`` in OpenGL.

This method is the same as :doc:`normal` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`normal`.
