@@ description
Rotates the shape around the z-axis the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from 0 to TWO_PI) or converted from degrees to radians with the ``radians()`` method.

Shapes are always rotated around the upper-left corner of their bounding box. Positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise direction. Subsequent calls to the method accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``rotate_z(half_pi)`` and then ``rotate_z(half_pi)`` is the same as ``rotate_z(pi)``. This transformation is applied directly to the shape, it's not refreshed each time ``draw()`` is run. 

This method requires a 3D renderer. You need to use P3D as a third parameter for the ``size()`` function as shown in the example above.

@@ example
PShape s;

void setup() {
  size(100, 100, P3D);
  s = loadShape("ohio.svg");
}

void draw() {
  background(204);
  shape(s);
}

void mousePressed() {
  // Rotate the shape around the z-axis each time the mouse is pressed
  s.rotateZ(0.1);  
}
