@@ description
Rotates the shape around the z-axis the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from 0 to TWO_PI) or converted from degrees to radians with the ``radians()`` method.

Shapes are always rotated around the upper-left corner of their bounding box. Positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise direction. Subsequent calls to the method accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``rotate_z(HALF_PI)`` and then ``rotate_z(HALF_PI)`` is the same as ``rotate_z(PI)``. This transformation is applied directly to the shape, it's not refreshed each time ``draw()`` is run. 

This method requires a 3D renderer. You need to use P3D as a third parameter for the ``size()`` function as shown in the example above.

@@ example


def setup():
    global s
    size(100, 100, P3D)
    s = load_shape("ohio.svg")


def draw():
    background(204)
    shape(s)


def mouse_pressed():
    # rotate the shape around the z-axis each time the mouse is pressed
    s.rotate_z(0.1)
