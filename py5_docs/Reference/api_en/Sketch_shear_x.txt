@@ description
Shears a shape around the x-axis the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from 0 to PI*2) or converted to radians with the ``radians()`` function. Objects are always sheared around their relative position to the origin and positive numbers shear objects in a clockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``shear_x(PI/2)`` and then ``shear_x(PI/2)`` is the same as ``shear_x(PI)``. If ``shear_x()`` is called within the ``draw()``, the transformation is reset when the loop begins again.
 
Technically, ``shear_x()`` multiplies the current transformation matrix by a rotation matrix. This function can be further controlled by the ``push_matrix()`` and ``pop_matrix()`` functions.
