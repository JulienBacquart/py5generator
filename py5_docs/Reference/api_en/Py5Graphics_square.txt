@@ description
Draws a square to the screen. A square is a four-sided shape with every angle at ninety degrees and each side is the same length. By default, the first two parameters set the location of the upper-left corner, the third sets the width and height. The way these parameters are interpreted, however, may be changed with the :doc:`py5graphics_rect_mode` function.

This method is the same as :doc:`square` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`square`.
