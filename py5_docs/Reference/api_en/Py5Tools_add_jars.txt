@@ description
Add all of the Java jar files contained in a directory and its subdirectories to the classpath.

When ``import py5`` is executed, ``add_jars('jars')`` is called for you to automatically add jar files contained in a subdirectory called jars. This is similar to functionality provided by the Processing IDE.

After the JVM has started, the classpath cannot be changed. This function will throw a ``RuntimeError`` if it is called after the JVM has already started. Use :doc:`is_jvm_running` to first determine if the JVM is running.
