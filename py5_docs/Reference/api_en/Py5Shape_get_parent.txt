get_parent() -> Py5Shape

@@ description
Locate a child `Py5Shape` object's parent `GROUP` `Py5Shape` object. This will return `None` if the shape has no parent, such as when the shape is the parent object or the shape is not a part of a group.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_get_parent_0.png

def setup():
    p = py5.create_shape(py5.GROUP)
    s1 = py5.create_shape(py5.RECT, 10, 10, 35, 35)
    p.add_child(s1)
    s2 = py5.create_shape(py5.RECT, 55, 10, 35, 35)
    p.add_child(s2)
    py5.shape(s2.get_parent())
