@@ description
Extracts the blue value from a color, scaled to match current ``color_mode()``. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an int value.

The ``blue()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit masking. When working in ``color_mode(RGB, 255)``, you can acheive the same results as ``blue()`` but with greater speed by using a bit mask to remove the other color components. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the blue value of the color value ``c``:

``b1 = blue(c)   # simpler, but slower to calculate
b2 = c & 0xFF  # very fast to calculate``

@@ example
image = blue_.png

c = color(175, 100, 220)  # define color 'c'
fill(c)  # use color variable 'c' as fill color
rect(15, 20, 35, 60)  # draw left rectangle

blue_value = blue(c)  # get blue in 'c'
print(blue_value)  # prints "220.0"
fill(0, 0, blue_value)  # use 'blue_value' in new fill
rect(50, 20, 35, 60)  # draw right rectangle
