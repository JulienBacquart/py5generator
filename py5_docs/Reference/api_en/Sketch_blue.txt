@@ description
Extracts the blue value from a color, scaled to match current ``color_mode()``. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an int value.

The ``blue()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit masking. When working in ``color_mode(rgb, 255)``, you can acheive the same results as ``blue()`` but with greater speed by using a bit mask to remove the other color components. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the blue value of the color value ``c``:

``float b1 = blue(c);   # _simpler, but slower to calculate
float b2 = c & 0x_ff;  # _very fast to calculate``

@@ example
image = blue_.png

color c = color(175, 100, 220);  // Define color 'c'
fill(c);  // Use color variable 'c' as fill color
rect(15, 20, 35, 60);  // Draw left rectangle

float blueValue = blue(c);  // Get blue in 'c'
println(blueValue);  // Prints "220.0"
fill(0, 0, blueValue);  // Use 'blueValue' in new fill
rect(50, 20, 35, 60);  // Draw right rectangle
