@@ description
Extracts the blue value from a color, scaled to match current ``color_mode()``. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an int value.

The ``blue()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit masking. When working in ``color_mode(rgb, 255)``, you can acheive the same results as ``blue()`` but with greater speed by using a bit mask to remove the other color components. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the blue value of the color value ``c``:

``float b1 = blue(c);   # _simpler, but slower to calculate
float b2 = c & 0x_ff;  # _very fast to calculate``

@@ example
image = blue_.png

color c = color(175, 100, 220)  fill(c)  rect(15, 20, 35, 60)  
float blue_value = blue(c)  print(blue_value)  fill(0, 0, blue_value)  rect(50, 20, 35, 60)
