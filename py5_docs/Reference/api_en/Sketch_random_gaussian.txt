@@ description
Returns a float from a random series of numbers having a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Each time the ``random_gaussian()`` function is called, it returns a number fitting a Gaussian, or normal, distribution. There is theoretically no minimum or maximum value that ``random_gaussian()`` might return. Rather, there is just a very low probability that values far from the mean will be returned; and a higher probability that numbers near the mean will be returned.

for y = range(0, 100):
    x = random_gaussian() * 15
    line(50, y, 50 + x, y)
