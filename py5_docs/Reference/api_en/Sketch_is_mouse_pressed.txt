@@ description
The ``is_mouse_pressed`` variable stores whether or not a mouse button is currently being pressed. The value is ``True`` when `any` mouse button is pressed, and ``False`` if no button is pressed. The :doc:`sketch_mouse_button` variable (see the related reference entry) can be used to determine which button has been pressed.

@@ example
# click within the image and press
# the left and right mouse buttons to
# change the value of the rectangle
def draw():
    if py5.is_mouse_pressed and py5.mouse_button == py5.LEFT:
        py5.fill(0)
    elif py5.is_mouse_pressed and py5.mouse_button == py5.RIGHT:
        py5.fill(255)
    else:
        py5.fill(126)

    py5.rect(25, 25, 50, 50)
