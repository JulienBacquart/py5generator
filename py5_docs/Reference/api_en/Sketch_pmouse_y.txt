@@ description
The system variable ``pmouse_y`` always contains the vertical position of the mouse in the frame previous to the current frame.

For more detail on how ``pmouse_y`` is updated inside of mouse events and ``draw()``, see the reference for ``pmouse_x``.

@@ example
# Move the mouse quickly to see the difference 
# between the current and previous position 
void draw() { 
  background(204) 
  line(20, mouseY, 80, pmouseY) 
  print(mouseY + " : " + pmouseY)
}
