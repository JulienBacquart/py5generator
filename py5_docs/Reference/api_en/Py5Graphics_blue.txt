@@ description
Extracts the blue value from a color, scaled to match current :doc:`py5graphics_color_mode`.

The ``blue()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a technique called bit masking. When working in ``color_mode(RGB, 255)``, you can achieve the same results as ``blue()`` but with greater speed by using a bit mask to remove the other color components. For example, ``blue(c)`` and ``c & 0xFF`` both extract the blue value from a color variable ``c`` but the later is faster.

This method is the same as :doc:`blue` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`blue`.
