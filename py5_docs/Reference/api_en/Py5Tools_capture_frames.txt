capture_frames(count: float, *, period: float = 0.0, sketch: Sketch = None) -> List[PIL.Image]

@@ variables
count: float - number of Sketch snapshots to capture
period: float = 0.0 - time in seconds between Sketch snapshots (default 0 means no delay)
sketch: Sketch = None - running Sketch

@@ description
Capture frames from a running Sketch.

By default the Sketch will be the currently running Sketch, as returned by :doc:`get_current_sketch`. Use the ``sketch`` parameter to specify a different running Sketch, such as a Sketch created using Class mode.

@@ example
import py5_tools

py5.run_sketch()
# capture 10 frames from the currently running sketch
frames = py5_tools.capture_frames(10, period=1)
