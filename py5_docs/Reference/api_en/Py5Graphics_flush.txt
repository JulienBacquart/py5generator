@@ description
Flush drawing commands to the renderer. For most renderers, this method does absolutely nothing. There are not a lot of good reasons to use this method, but if you need it, it is available for your use.

This method is the same as :doc:`sketch_flush` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object.
