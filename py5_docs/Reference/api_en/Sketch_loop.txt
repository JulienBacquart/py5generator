@@ description
By default, Processing loops through ``draw()`` continuously, executing the code within it. However, the ``draw()`` loop may be stopped by calling ``no_loop()``. In that case, the ``draw()`` loop can be resumed with ``loop()``.

@@ example
def setup():
    size(200, 200)
    no_loop()  # draw() will not loop


x = 0


def draw():
    background(204)
    x = x + .1
    if x > width:
        x = 0

    line(x, 0, x, height)


def mouse_pressed():
    loop()  # holding down the mouse activates looping


def mouse_released():
    no_loop()  # releasing the mouse stops looping draw()
