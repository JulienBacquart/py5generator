loop() -> None

@@ description
By default, Processing loops through ``draw()`` continuously, executing the code within it. However, the ``draw()`` loop may be stopped by calling ``no_loop()``. In that case, the ``draw()`` loop can be resumed with ``loop()``.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.size(200, 200)
    py5.no_loop()  # draw() will not loop


x = 0


def draw():
    py5.background(204)
    x = x + .1
    if x > py5.width:
        x = 0

    py5.line(x, 0, x, py5.height)


def mouse_pressed():
    py5.loop()  # holding down the mouse activates looping


def mouse_released():
    py5.no_loop()  # releasing the mouse stops looping draw()
