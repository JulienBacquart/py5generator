@@ description
Increases or decreases the size of a shape by expanding and contracting vertices. Shapes always scale from the relative origin of their bounding box. Scale values are specified as decimal percentages. For example, the method call ``scale(2.0)`` increases the dimension of a shape by 200%. Subsequent calls to the method multiply the effect. For example, calling ``scale(2.0)`` and then ``scale(1.5)`` is the same as ``scale(3.0)``. This transformation is applied directly to the shape; it's not refreshed each time ``draw()`` is run. 

Using this method with the ``z`` parameter requires using the P3D parameter in combination with size.

def setup():
    global s
    s = load_shape("bot.svg")


def draw():
    background(204)
    shape(s)


def mouse_pressed():
    # shrink the shape 90% each time the mouse is pressed
    s.scale(0.9)
