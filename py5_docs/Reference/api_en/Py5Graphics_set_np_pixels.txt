set_np_pixels(array: np.ndarray, bands: str = 'ARGB') -> None

array: np.ndarray - properly sized numpy array to be copied to np_pixels[]
bands: str = 'ARGB' - color channels in the array's third dimension

@@ description
Set the entire contents of :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` to the contents of another properly sized and typed numpy array. The size of ``array``'s first and second dimensions must match the height and width of the Sketch window, respectively. The array's ``dtype`` must be ``np.uint8``.

The ``bands`` parameter is used to interpret the ``array``'s color channel dimension (the array's third dimension). It can be one of ``'L'`` (single-channel grayscale), ``'ARGB'``, ``'RGB'``, or ``'RGBA'``. If there is no alpha channel, ``array`` is assumed to have no transparency, but recall that the Py5Graphics canvas's pixels can never be transparent so any transparency in ``array`` will have no effect. If the ``bands`` parameter is ``'L'``, ``array``'s third dimension is optional.

This method makes calls to :doc:`py5graphics_load_np_pixels` and :doc:`py5graphics_update_np_pixels` so there is no need to call either explicitly.

This method is the same as :doc:`set_np_pixels` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`set_np_pixels`.
