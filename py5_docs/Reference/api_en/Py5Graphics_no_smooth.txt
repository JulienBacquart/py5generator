@@ description
Draws all geometry and fonts with jagged (aliased) edges and images with hard edges between the pixels when enlarged rather than interpolating pixels.  Note that :doc:`py5graphics_smooth` is active by default, so it is necessary to call ``no_smooth()`` to disable smoothing of geometry, fonts, and images. The ``no_smooth()`` function can only be run once for each Sketch and must be called in ``settings()``.

This method is the same as :doc:`no_smooth` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`no_smooth`.
