@@ description
Run the Sketch. Code in the ``settings()``, ``setup()``, and ``draw()`` functions will be used to actualize your Sketch.

Use the ``block`` parameter to specify if the call to ``run_sketch()`` should return immediately or block until the Sketch exits. If the ``block`` parameter is not specified, py5 will first attempt to determine if the Sketch is running in a Jupyter Notebook or an IPython shell. If it is, ``block`` will default to ``False``, and ``True`` otherwise.

A list of strings passed to ``py5_options`` will be passed to the Processing PApplet class as arguments to specify characteristics such as the window's location on the screen. A list of strings passed to ``sketch_args`` will be available to a running Sketch using :doc:`args`. See the third example for an example of how this can be used.

When calling ``run_sketch()`` in module mode, py5 will by default search for functions such as ``setup()``,  ``draw()``, etc. in the caller's stack frame and use those in the Sketch. If for some reason that is not what you want or does not work because you are hacking py5 to do something unusual, you can use the ``sketch_functions`` parameter to pass a dictionary of the desired callable functions. The ``sketch_functions`` parameter is not available when coding py5 in class mode. Don't forget you can always replace the ``draw()`` function in a running Sketch using :doc:`hot_reload_draw`.

By default, a Sketch's print statements will be printed out as one would expect. When running a Sketch through Jupyter Notebook, print statements will always go to the output of the cell that made the ``run_sketch()`` call. This will continue to be true if the user moves on to execute code in other Notebook cells. Use the ``stream_redirect`` parameter to customize stdout and stderr handling. This can be used to redirect print statements to a log file or an IPython widget. See the example code for more information.
