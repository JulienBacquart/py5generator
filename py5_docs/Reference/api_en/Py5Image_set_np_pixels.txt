@@ description
Set the entire contents of :doc:`py5image_np_pixels` to the contents of another properly sized and typed numpy array. The size of ``array``'s first and second dimensions must match the height and width of the image, respectively. 

The ``bands`` parameter is used to interpret the ``array``'s color channel dimension (the array's third dimension). It can be can be one of ``'L'`` (single-channel grayscale), ``'ARGB'``, ``'RGB'``, or ``'RGBA'``. If there is no alpha channel, ``array`` is assumed to have no transparency. If the ``bands`` parameter is ``'L'``, ``array``'s third dimension is optional.

This method makes calls to :doc:`py5image_load_np_pixels` and :doc:`py5image_update_np_pixels` so there is no need to call either explicitly.
