load_np_pixels() -> None

@@ description
Loads the pixel data of the current display window into the [](sketch_np_pixels) array. This method must always be called before reading from or writing to [](sketch_np_pixels). Subsequent changes to the display window will not be reflected in [](sketch_np_pixels) until `load_np_pixels()` is called again.

The `load_np_pixels()` method is similar to [](sketch_load_pixels) in that `load_np_pixels()` must be called before reading from or writing to [](sketch_np_pixels) just as [](sketch_load_pixels) must be called before reading from or writing to [](sketch_pixels).

Note that `load_np_pixels()` will as a side effect call [](sketch_load_pixels), so if your code needs to read [](sketch_np_pixels) and [](sketch_pixels) simultaneously, there is no need for a separate call to [](sketch_load_pixels). However, be aware that modifying both [](sketch_np_pixels) and [](sketch_pixels) simultaneously will likely result in the updates to [](sketch_pixels) being discarded.

@@ example
image = Sketch_load_np_pixels_0.png

def setup():
    my_image = py5.load_image("apples.jpg")
    py5.image(my_image, 0, 0)
    
    py5.load_np_pixels()
    py5.np_pixels[50:100, :, :] = py5.np_pixels[:50, :, :]
    py5.update_np_pixels()
