lerp(other: Union[Py5Vector, np.ndarray], amt: Union[float, np.ndarray]) -> Union[Py5Vector, np.ndarray[np.floating]]

@@ variables
amt: Union[float, np.ndarray] - float between 0.0 and 1.0
other: Union[Py5Vector, np.ndarray] - other vector to interpolate between

@@ description
Calculates a vector between two vectors at a specific increment. The two vectors must have the same dimension. The `amt` parameter is the amount to interpolate between the two values where 0.0 equal to the first point, 0.1 is very near the first point, 0.5 is half-way in between, etc. If the `amt` parameter is greater than 1.0 or less than 0.0, the interpolated vector will be outside of the range specified by the two vectors.

This method is similar to [](sketch_lerp) and [](sketch_lerp_color), but for vectors instead of numbers or colors.

    v2 = py5.Py5Vector(-40, -80)
    c2 = py5.color(0, 0, 255)
    py5.translate(50, 90)
    py5.stroke_weight(4)
    py5.stroke(c1)
    py5.line(0, 0, v1.x, v1.y)
    py5.stroke(c2)
    py5.line(0, 0, v2.x, v2.y)
    py5.stroke_weight(1)
    for i in range(1, 10):
        v = v1.lerp(v2, i / 10)
        c = py5.lerp_color(c1, c2, i / 10)
        py5.stroke(c)
        py5.line(0, 0, v.x, v.y)
