other: Union[Py5Vector, NDArray] - other vector to interpolate between

@@ description
Calculates a vector between two vectors at a specific increment. The two vectors must have the same dimension. The ``amt`` parameter is the amount to interpolate between the two values where 0.0 equal to the first point, 0.1 is very near the first point, 0.5 is half-way in between, etc. If the ``amt`` parameter is greater than 1.0 or less than 0.0, the interpolated vector will be outside of the range specified by the two vectors.

This method is similar to :doc:`sketch_lerp`, but for vectors instead of numbers.
