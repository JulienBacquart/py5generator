@@ description
Calculates a vector between two vectors at a specific increment. The two vectors must have the same dimension. The ``amt`` parameter is the amount to interpolate between the two values where 0.0 equal to the first point, 0.1 is very near the first point, 0.5 is half-way in between, etc.

This method is similar to :doc:`sketch_lerp`, but for vectors instead of numbers.
