shear_y(angle: float, /) -> None

angle: float - angle of shear specified in radians

@@ description
Shears a shape around the y-axis the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from ``0`` to ``TWO_PI``) or converted to radians with the :doc:`sketch_radians` function. Objects are always sheared around their relative position to the origin and positive numbers shear objects in a clockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``shear_y(PI/2)`` and then ``shear_y(PI/2)`` is the same as ``shear_y(PI)``. If ``shear_y()`` is called within the ``draw()``, the transformation is reset when the loop begins again.
 
Technically, ``shear_y()`` multiplies the current transformation matrix by a rotation matrix. This function can be further controlled by the :doc:`sketch_push_matrix` and :doc:`sketch_pop_matrix` functions.
