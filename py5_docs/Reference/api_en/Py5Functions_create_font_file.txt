@@ description
Utility function to create Processing's vlw font data files. In Processing, users would create these files through the PDE using the Create Font tool. This utility function accomplishes the same task.

By default it will create data files for every character available in the specified font. To reduce execution time and output file size, limit the characters using the ``characters`` parameter. The default output filename is ``{font_name}-{font_size}.vlw`` and will be saved to the current directory.

This utility function opens a window that displays a short message about the number of glyphs written to the file. To make the window close automatically, set the ``pause`` parameter to ``False``.

Get a list of font names available on your computer with Py5Font's :doc:`py5font_list` method.
