@@ description
Save the current running sketch's frames to a directory.

Use the -w argument to wait before starting.

The below example will save the next 50 frames to the `/tmp/frames` directory after a 3 second delay. The filenames will be saved with the default name 'frame_####.png' with numbering that starts at 0.

```
    %py5saveframes /tmp/frames -w 3 -s 0 --limit 50
```

If a limit is given, this line magic will wait to return a list of the filenames. Otherwise, it will return right away as the frames are saved in the background. It will keep doing so as long as the sketch continues to run.
