stroke_weight(weight: float, /) -> None

weight: float - the weight (in pixels) of the stroke

@@ description
Sets the width of the stroke used for lines and points in a ``Py5Shape`` object. All widths are set in units of pixels.

This method can only be used within a :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape` pair.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_stroke_weight_0.png

    s.vertex(20, 0)
    s.vertex(80, 0)
    s.end_shape()

    py5.shape(make_line(4), 0, 40)
