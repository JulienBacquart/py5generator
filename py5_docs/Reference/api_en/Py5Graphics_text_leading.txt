text_leading(leading: float, /) -> None

@@ variables
leading: float - the size in pixels for spacing between lines

@@ description
Sets the spacing between lines of text in units of pixels. This setting will be used in all subsequent calls to the :doc:`py5graphics_text` function.  Note, however, that the leading is reset by :doc:`py5graphics_text_size`. For example, if the leading is set to 20 with ``text_leading(20)``, then if ``text_size(48)`` is run at a later point, the leading will be reset to the default for the text size of 48.

This method is the same as :doc:`text_leading` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`text_leading`.
