@@ description
The Sketch's current path. If the ``where`` parameter is used, the result will be a subdirectory of the current path. 

Result will be relative to Python's current working directory (``os.getcwd()``) unless it was specifically set to something else with the :doc:`sketch_run_sketch` call by including a ``--sketch-path`` argument in the ``py5_options`` parameters.
