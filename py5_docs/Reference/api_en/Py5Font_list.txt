list() -> List[str]

@@ description
Gets a list of the fonts installed on the system. The data is returned as a list of strings. This list provides the names of each font for input into ``create_font()``, which allows py5 to dynamically format fonts.

This works outside of a running sketch.

@@ example
font_list = py5.Py5Font.list()
print(font_list)
