list() -> list[str]

@@ description
Gets a list of the fonts installed on the system. The data is returned as a list of strings. This list provides the names of each font for input into :doc:`sketch_create_font`, which allows py5 to dynamically format fonts.

This works outside of a running Sketch.

@@ example
font_list = py5.Py5Font.list()
print(font_list)
