@@ description
Get the `Py5Shape` object's width. When using the `P2D` or `P3D` renderers, the value should be the width of the drawn shape. When using the default renderer, this will be the width of the drawing area, which will not necessarily be the same as the width of the drawn shape. Consider that the shape's vertices might have negative values or the shape may be offset from the shape's origin. To get the shape's actual width, calculate the range of the vertices obtained with [](py5shape_get_vertex_x).
