@@ description
The ``set_fill()`` method defines the fill color of a ``Py5Shape``. This method is used after shapes are created or when a shape is defined explicitly (e.g. ``create_shape(RECT, 20, 20, 80, 80)``) as shown in the above example. When a shape is created with ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()``, its attributes may be changed with ``fill()`` and ``stroke()`` within ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()``. However, after the shape is created, only the ``set_fill()`` method can define a new fill value for the ``Py5Shape``.

def setup():
    global circle
    size(640, 360, P2D)
    circle = create_shape(ELLIPSE, 0, 0, 200, 200)
    circle.set_stroke(color(255))


def draw():
    background(51)
    circle.set_fill(color(random(255)))
    translate(mouse_x, mouse_y)
    shape(circle)
