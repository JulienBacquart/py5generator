@@ description
The ``set_fill()`` method defines the fill color of a ``Py5Shape``. This method is used after shapes are created or when a shape is defined explicitly (e.g. ``create_shape(rect, 20, 20, 80, 80)``) as shown in the above example. When a shape is created with ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()``, its attributes may be changed with ``fill()`` and ``stroke()`` within ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()``. However, after the shape is created, only the ``set_fill()`` method can define a new fill value for the ``Py5Shape``.

@@ example
PShape circle

void setup() {  
  size(640, 360, P2D)
  circle = createShape(ELLIPSE, 0, 0, 200, 200)
  circle.setStroke(color(255))  
}

void draw() {
  background(51)
  circle.setFill(color(random(255)))
  translate(mouseX, mouseY)
  shape(circle)
}
