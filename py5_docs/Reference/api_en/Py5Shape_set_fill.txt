@@ description
The ``set_fill()`` method defines the fill color of a ``Py5Shape``. This method is used after shapes are created or when a shape is defined explicitly (e.g. ``create_shape(RECT, 20, 20, 60, 60)``) as shown in the example. When a shape is created with :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape`, its attributes may be changed with :doc:`py5shape_fill` and :doc:`py5shape_stroke` between the calls to :doc:`py5shape_begin_shape` and :doc:`py5shape_end_shape`. However, after the shape is created, only the ``set_fill()`` method can define a new fill value for the ``Py5Shape``.
