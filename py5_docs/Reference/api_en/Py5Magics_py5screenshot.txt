@@ description
Take a screenshot of the current running sketch.

Use the -w argument to wait before taking the screenshot.

The returned image is a `PIL.Image` object. It can be assigned to a variable or embedded in the notebook.

Below is an example demonstrating how to take a screenshot after a two second delay and assign it to the `img` variable. The image is then saved to a file. When run from a notebook, the image is embedded in the output.

```
    img = %py5screenshot -w 2
    img.save('image.png')
    img
```
