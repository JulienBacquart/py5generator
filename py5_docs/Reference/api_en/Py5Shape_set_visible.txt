@@ description
Sets the shape to be visible or invisible. This is determined by the value of the ``visible`` parameter.

The default visibility of a shape is usually controlled by whatever program created the SVG file. For instance, this parameter is controlled by showing or hiding the shape in the layers palette in Adobe Illustrator.

@@ example


def setup():
    global s
    size(100, 100)
    # the file "bot.svg" must be in the data folder
    # of the current sketch to load successfully
    s = load_shape("bot.svg")


def draw():
    background(204)
    shape(s, 10, 10, 80, 80)  # draw shape
    s.set_visible(is_mouse_pressed())
    if s.is_visible() == False:  # or use: "if (!s.isVisible)"
        no_fill()
