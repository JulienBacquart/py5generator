@@ description
Updates the Py5Graphics canvas with the data in the :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` array. Use in conjunction with :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels`. If you're only reading pixels from the array, there's no need to call ``update_pixels()`` â€” updating is only necessary to apply changes.

This method is the same as :doc:`update_pixels` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`update_pixels`.
