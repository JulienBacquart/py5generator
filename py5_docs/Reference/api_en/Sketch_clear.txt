@@ description
Clears the pixels within a buffer. This function only works on ``Py5Graphics`` objects created with the ``create_graphics()`` function. Unlike the main graphics context (the display window), pixels in additional graphics areas created with ``create_graphics()`` can be entirely or partially transparent. This function clears everything in a ``Py5Graphics`` object to make all of the pixels 100% transparent.

@@ example
Py5Graphics pg

void setup() {
  size(200, 200)
  pg = create_graphics(width, height)
}

void draw() {
  background(204)
  
    if (mouse_pressed == true) {
    pg.begin_draw() 
    pg.clear()
    pg.end_draw()
  } else {
    pg.begin_draw()
    pg.stroke(0, 102, 153)
    pg.line(width/2, height/2, mouse_x, mouse_y)
    pg.end_draw()
  }

  image(pg, 0, 0)
}
