@@ description
Clears the pixels within a buffer. This function only works on ``Py5Graphics`` objects created with the ``create_graphics()`` function. Unlike the main graphics context (the display window), pixels in additional graphics areas created with ``create_graphics()`` can be entirely or partially transparent. This function clears everything in a ``Py5Graphics`` object to make all of the pixels 100% transparent.

@@ example


def setup():
    global pg
    size(200, 200)
    pg = create_graphics(width, height)


def draw():
    background(204)
   
    # clear the Py5Graphics when the mouse is pressed
    if mouse_pressed == True:
        pg.begin_draw() 
        pg.clear()
        pg.end_draw()
    else:
        pg.begin_draw()
        pg.stroke(0, 102, 153)
        pg.line(width/2, height/2, mouse_x, mouse_y)
        pg.end_draw()


    image(pg, 0, 0)
