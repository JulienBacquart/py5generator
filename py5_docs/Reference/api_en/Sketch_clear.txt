@@ description
Clears the pixels within a buffer. This function only works on ``Py5Graphics`` objects created with the ``create_graphics()`` function. Unlike the main graphics context (the display window), pixels in additional graphics areas created with ``create_graphics()`` can be entirely or partially transparent. This function clears everything in a ``Py5Graphics`` object to make all of the pixels 100% transparent.

@@ example
def settings():
    py5.size(200, 200)


def setup():
    global pg
    pg = py5.create_graphics(py5.width, py5.height)


def draw():
    py5.background(204)

    # clear the Py5Graphics when the mouse is pressed
    if py5.is_mouse_pressed:
        pg.begin_draw()
        pg.clear()
        pg.end_draw()
    else:
        pg.begin_draw()
        pg.stroke(0, 102, 153)
        pg.line(py5.width//2, py5.height//2, py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y)
        pg.end_draw()

    py5.image(pg, 0, 0)
