@@ description
Clears the pixels within a buffer. This function only works on ``Py5Graphics`` objects created with the ``create_graphics()`` function. Unlike the main graphics context (the display window), pixels in additional graphics areas created with ``create_graphics()`` can be entirely or partially transparent. This function clears everything in a ``Py5Graphics`` object to make all of the pixels 100% transparent.

@@ example
PGraphics pg

void setup() {
  size(200, 200)
  pg = createGraphics(width, height)
}

void draw() {
  background(204)
  
  # Clear the PGraphics when the mouse is pressed
  if (mousePressed == true) {
    pg.beginDraw() 
    pg.clear()
    pg.endDraw()
  } else {
    pg.beginDraw()
    pg.stroke(0, 102, 153)
    pg.line(width/2, height/2, mouseX, mouseY)
    pg.endDraw()
  }

  image(pg, 0, 0)
}
