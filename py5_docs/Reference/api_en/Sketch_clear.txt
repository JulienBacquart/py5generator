clear() -> None

@@ description
Clear the drawing surface by setting every pixel to black. Calling this method is the same as passing ``0`` to the :doc:`sketch_background` method, as in ``background(0)``.

This method behaves differently than :doc:`py5graphics_clear` because ``Py5Graphics`` objects allow transparent pixels.

@@ example
image = Sketch_clear_0.png

def setup():
    py5.fill(255)
    py5.rect(5, 5, 40, 40)
    py5.clear()
    py5.rect(55, 55, 40, 40)
