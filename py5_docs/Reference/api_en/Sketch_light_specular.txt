@@ description
Sets the specular color for lights. Like ``fill()``, it affects only the elements which are created after it in the code. Specular refers to light which bounces off a surface in a preferred direction (rather than bouncing in all directions like a diffuse light) and is used for creating highlights. The specular quality of a light interacts with the specular material qualities set through the ``specular()`` and ``shininess()`` functions.
