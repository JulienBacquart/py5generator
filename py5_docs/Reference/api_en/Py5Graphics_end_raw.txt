@@ description
Complement to :doc:`py5graphics_begin_raw`; they must always be used together. See the :doc:`py5graphics_begin_raw` reference for details.

This method is the same as :doc:`sketch_end_raw` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`sketch_end_raw`.
