@@ description
Set a new width and height for the Sketch window. You do not need to call :doc:`sketch_window_resizable` before calling this.

Changing the window size will clear the drawing canvas. If you do this, the :doc:`sketch_width` and :doc:`sketch_height` variables will change.

This method provides the same funcationality as :doc:`py5surface_set_size` but without the need to interact directly with the :doc:`py5surface` object.

@@ example
def draw():
    py5.square(py5.random(py5.width), py5.random(py5.height), 10)

py5.run_sketch(block=False)

# while the sketch is running, change the window size
py5.window_size(400, 400)
