@@ description
Draws an ellipse (oval) to the screen. An ellipse with equal width and height is a circle. By default, the first two parameters set the location, and the third and fourth parameters set the shape's width and height. The origin may be changed with the [](py5graphics_ellipse_mode) function.

This method is the same as [](sketch_ellipse) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_ellipse).
