load_np_pixels() -> None

@@ description
Loads the pixel data of the current Py5Graphics canvas into the :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` array. This method must always be called before reading from or writing to :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels`. Subsequent changes to the Py5Graphics canvas will not be reflected in :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` until ``load_np_pixels()`` is called again.

The ``load_np_pixels()`` method is similar to :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels` in that ``load_np_pixels()`` must be called before reading from or writing to :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` just as :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels` must be called before reading from or writing to :doc:`py5graphics_pixels`.

Note that ``load_np_pixels()`` will as a side effect call :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels`, so if your code needs to read :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` and :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` simultaneously, there is no need for a separate call to :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels`. However, be aware that modifying both :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` and :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` simultaneously will likely result in the updates to :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` being discarded.

This method is the same as :doc:`load_np_pixels` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`load_np_pixels`.
