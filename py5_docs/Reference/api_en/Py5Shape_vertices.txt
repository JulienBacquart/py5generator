vertices(coordinates: npt.NDArray[np.floating], /) -> None

@@ variables
coordinates: npt.NDArray[np.floating] - 2D array of vertex coordinates with 2 or 3 columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively

@@ description
Create a collection of vertices. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling [](py5shape_vertex) in a loop. For a large number of vertices, the performance of `vertices()` will be much faster.

The `coordinates` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each vertex. There should be two or three columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_vertices_0.png

import numpy as np

def setup():
    random_triangle_vertices = 100 * np.random.rand(25, 2)
    s = py5.create_shape()
    with s.begin_shape(s.TRIANGLES):
        s.vertices(random_triangle_vertices)
    py5.shape(s)
