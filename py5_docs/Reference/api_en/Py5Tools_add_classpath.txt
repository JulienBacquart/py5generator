add_classpath(classpath: Union[Path, str]) -> None

classpath: Union[Path, str] - path to Java jar file

@@ description
Add a Java jar file to the classpath. The path to the file can be absolute or relative.

After the JVM has started, the classpath cannot be changed. This function will throw a ``RuntimeError`` if it is called after the JVM has already started. Use :doc:`is_jvm_running` to first determine if the JVM is running.
