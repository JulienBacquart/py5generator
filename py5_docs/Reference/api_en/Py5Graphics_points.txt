@@ description
Draw a collection of points, each a coordinate in space at the dimension of one pixel. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling :doc:`py5graphics_point` in a loop. For a large number of points, the performance of ``points()`` will be much faster.

The ``coordinates`` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each point. There should be two or three columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively.

This method is the same as :doc:`points` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`points`.
