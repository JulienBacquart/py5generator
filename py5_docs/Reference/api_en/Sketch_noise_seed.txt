noise_seed(seed: int) -> None

seed: int - seed value

@@ description
Sets the seed value for :doc:`noise`. By default, :doc:`noise` produces different results each time the program is run. Set the seed parameter to a constant to return the same pseudo-random numbers each time the Sketch is run.

Py5's noise functionality is provided by the Python noise library. The noise library provides more advanced features than what is documented here. To use the more advanced features, import that library directly.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.noise_seed(42)
    py5.stroke(0, 10)


def draw():
    n = py5.remap(py5.noise(py5.frame_count / 100), -1, 1, 0, 1) * py5.width
    py5.line(n, 0, n, py5.height)
