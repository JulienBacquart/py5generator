@@ description
Rotates the shape the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from 0 to TWO_PI) or converted from degrees to radians with the ``radians()`` method.

Shapes are always rotated around the upper-left corner of their bounding box. Positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the method accumulates the effect. For example, calling ``rotate(half_pi)`` and then ``rotate(half_pi)`` is the same as ``rotate(pi)``. This transformation is applied directly to the shape, it's not refreshed each time ``draw()`` is run.

@@ example
PShape s

void setup() {
  size(100, 100)
  s = loadShape("ohio.svg")
}

void draw() {
  background(204)
  shape(s)
}

void mousePressed() {
  # Rotate the shape each time the mouse is pressed
  s.rotate(0.1)  
}
