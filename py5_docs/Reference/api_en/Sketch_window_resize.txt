@@ description
Set a new width and height for the Sketch window. You do not need to call [](sketch_window_resizable) before calling this.

Changing the window size will clear the drawing canvas. If you do this, the [](sketch_width) and [](sketch_height) variables will change.

This method provides the same functionality as [](py5surface_set_size) but without the need to interact directly with the [](py5surface) object.

@@ example
def draw():
    py5.square(py5.random(py5.width), py5.random(py5.height), 10)

py5.run_sketch(block=False)

# while the sketch is running, change the window size
py5.window_resize(400, 400)
