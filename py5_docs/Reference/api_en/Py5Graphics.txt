@@ description
Main graphics and rendering context, as well as the base ``API`` implementation for processing "core". Use this class if you need to draw into an off-screen graphics buffer. A Py5Graphics object can be constructed with the :doc:`create_graphics` function. The :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw` and :doc:`py5graphics_end_draw` methods (see example) are necessary to set up the buffer and to finalize it. The fields and methods for this class are extensive.

To create a new graphics context, use the :doc:`create_graphics` function. Do not use the syntax ``Py5Graphics()``.

@@ example
def setup():
    global pg
    pg = py5.create_graphics(40, 40)


def draw():
    pg.begin_draw()
    pg.background(100)
    pg.stroke(255)
    pg.line(20, 20, py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y)
    pg.end_draw()
    py5.image(pg, 9, 30)
    py5.image(pg, 51, 30)
