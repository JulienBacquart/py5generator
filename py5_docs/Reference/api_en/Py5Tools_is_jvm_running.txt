is_jvm_running() -> bool

@@ description
Determine if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is or is not running. When the py5 library is imported it will start the JVM.  Therefore this will be ``False`` before ``import py5`` is executed and ``True`` afterwards. It should continue to always be ``True`` unless somewhere there is some Java code that calls ``System.exit()``. Calling ``System.exit()`` is not recommended. If for some reason the JVM crashes (perhaps through a segmentation fault), the JVM will no longer be running, but that crash will most likely also terminate the Python interpreter.

@@ example
import py5_tools

# this will be False
print(py5_tools.is_jvm_running())

import py5

# now it will be True
print(py5_tools.is_jvm_running())
