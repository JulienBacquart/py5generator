@@ description
Rotates the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles must be specified in radians (values from ``0`` to ``TWO_PI``), or they can be converted from degrees to radians with the ``radians()`` function. 
 
The coordinates are always rotated around their relative position to the origin. Positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise direction and negative numbers rotate in the couterclockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens afterward, and subsequent calls to the function compound the effect. For example, calling ``rotate(pi/2.0)`` once and then calling ``rotate(pi/2.0)`` a second time is the same as a single ``rotate(pi)``. All tranformations are reset when ``draw()`` begins again. 
 
Technically, ``rotate()`` multiplies the current transformation matrix by a rotation matrix. This function can be further controlled by ``push_matrix()`` and ``pop_matrix()``.
