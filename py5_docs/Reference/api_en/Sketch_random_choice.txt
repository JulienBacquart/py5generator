random_choice(objects: list[Any], size: int=1, replace: bool=True) -> Any

@@ variables
objects: list[Any] - list of objects to choose from
replace: bool=True - whether to select random items with or without replacement
size: int=1 - number of random items to select

@@ description
Select random items from a list. The list items can be of any type. If multiple items are selected, this function will by default allow the same item to be selected multiple times. Set the ``replace`` parameter to ``False`` to prevent the same item from being selected multiple times.

This function's randomness can be influenced by :doc:`sketch_random_seed`, and makes calls to numpy to select the random items.

@@ example
def setup():
    words = ["apple", "bear", "cat", "dog"]
    word = py5.random_choice(words)
    py5.println(word)  # Prints one of the four words
