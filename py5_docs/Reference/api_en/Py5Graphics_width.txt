@@ description
System variable that stores the width of the Py5Graphics canvas. This value is set by the first parameter of the :doc:`size` function. For example, the function call ``size(320, 240)`` sets the ``width`` variable to the value 320. The value of ``width`` defaults to 100 if :doc:`size` is not used in a program.

This field is the same as :doc:`width` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`width`.
