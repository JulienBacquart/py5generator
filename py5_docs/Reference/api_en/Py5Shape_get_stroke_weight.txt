@@ description
Gets the width of the stroke used for lines and points in a `Py5Shape` object. All widths are set in units of pixels. This method can get the stroke weight assigned to each vertex, but most likely the value will be the same for all vertices.

This method can only be used for a complete `Py5Shape` object, and never within a [](py5shape_begin_shape) and [](py5shape_end_shape) pair.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_get_stroke_weight_0.png

def setup():
    py5.stroke_weight(4)
    s = py5.create_shape(py5.RECT, 20, 20, 60, 60)
    py5.shape(s)

    py5.println(s.get_stroke_weight(0)) # 4.0
