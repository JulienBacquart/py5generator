coordinates: npt.NDArray[np.floating] - 2D array of curve vertex coordinates with 2 or 3 columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively

@@ description
Create a collection of curve vertices. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling [](py5shape_curve_vertex) in a loop. For a large number of curve vertices, the performance of `curve_vertices()` will be much faster.

The `coordinates` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each curve vertex.  There should be two or three columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively.
