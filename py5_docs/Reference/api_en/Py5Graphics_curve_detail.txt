curve_detail(detail: int, /) -> None

@@ variables
detail: int - resolution of the curves

@@ description
Sets the resolution at which curves display. The default value is 20. This function is only useful when using the `P3D` renderer as the default `P2D` renderer does not use this information.

This method is the same as [](sketch_curve_detail) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_curve_detail).
