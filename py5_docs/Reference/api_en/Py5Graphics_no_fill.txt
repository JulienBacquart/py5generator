no_fill() -> None

@@ description
Disables filling geometry. If both :doc:`py5graphics_no_stroke` and ``no_fill()`` are called, nothing will be drawn to the screen.

This method is the same as :doc:`sketch_no_fill` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`sketch_no_fill`.
