@@ description
The system variable ``mouse_y`` always contains the current vertical coordinate of the mouse.

Note that Processing can only track the mouse position when the pointer is over the current window. The default value of ``mouse_y`` is ``0``, so ``0`` will be returned until the mouse moves in front of the sketch window. (This typically happens when a sketch is first run.)  Once the mouse moves away from the window, ``mouse_y`` will continue to report its most recent position.

@@ example
def draw():
    background(204)
    line(20, mouse_y, 80, mouse_y)
