load_pixels() -> None

@@ description
Loads the pixel data of the current Py5Graphics canvas into the :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` array. This function must always be called before reading from or writing to :doc:`py5graphics_pixels`. Subsequent changes to the Py5Graphics canvas will not be reflected in :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` until ``load_pixels()`` is called again.

This method is the same as :doc:`load_pixels` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`load_pixels`.
