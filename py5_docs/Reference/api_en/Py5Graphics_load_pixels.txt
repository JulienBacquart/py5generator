load_pixels() -> None

@@ description
Loads the pixel data of the current Py5Graphics drawing surface into the :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` array. This function must always be called before reading from or writing to :doc:`py5graphics_pixels`. Subsequent changes to the Py5Graphics drawing surface will not be reflected in :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` until ``load_pixels()`` is called again.

This method is the same as :doc:`load_pixels` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object.

@@ example
image = Py5Graphics_load_pixels_0.png

def setup():
    g = py5.create_graphics(60, 60)
    g.begin_draw()
    g.background(255, 0, 0)
    g.rect(10, 10, 40, 40)
    g.load_pixels()
    yellow = "#FF0"
    for i in range(len(g.pixels) // 2):
        g.pixels[i] = yellow
    g.update_pixels()
    g.end_draw()

    py5.background(240)
    py5.image(g, 20, 20)
