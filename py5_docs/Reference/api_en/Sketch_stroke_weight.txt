@@ description
Sets the width of the stroke used for lines, points, and the border around shapes. All widths are set in units of pixels.

Using ``point()`` with strokeWeight(1) or smaller may draw nothing to the screen, depending on the graphics settings of the computer. Workarounds include setting the pixel using ``set()`` or drawing the point using either ``circle()`` or ``square()``.

@@ example

stroke_weight(1)  # default
line(20, 20, 80, 20)
stroke_weight(4)  # thicker
line(20, 40, 80, 40)
stroke_weight(10)  # beastly
line(20, 70, 80, 70)
