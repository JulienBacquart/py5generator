@@ description
Sets the width of the stroke used for lines, points, and the border around shapes. All widths are set in units of pixels.

Using ``point()`` with strokeWeight(1) or smaller may draw nothing to the screen, depending on the graphics settings of the computer. Workarounds include setting the pixel using ``set()`` or drawing the point using either ``circle()`` or ``square()``.

@@ example
image = strokeWeight_.png

strokeWeight(1);  // Default
line(20, 20, 80, 20);
strokeWeight(4);  // Thicker
line(20, 40, 80, 40);
strokeWeight(10);  // Beastly
line(20, 70, 80, 70);
