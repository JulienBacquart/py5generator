stroke_weight(weight: float, /) -> None

@@ variables
weight: float - the weight (in pixels) of the stroke

@@ description
Sets the width of the stroke used for lines, points, and the border around shapes. All widths are set in units of pixels.

Using :doc:`sketch_point` with ``strokeWeight(1)`` or smaller may draw nothing to the screen, depending on the graphics settings of the computer. Workarounds include setting the pixel using the :doc:`sketch_pixels` or :doc:`sketch_np_pixels` arrays or drawing the point using either :doc:`sketch_circle` or :doc:`sketch_square`.
