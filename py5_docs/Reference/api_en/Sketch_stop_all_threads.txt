wait: bool = False - wait for thread to exit before returning

@@ description
Stop all running threads. The ``wait`` parameter determines if the method call will return right away or wait for the threads to exit.

When the Sketch shuts down, ``stop_all_threads(wait=False)`` is called for you. If you would rather the Sketch waited for threads to exit, create an ``exiting`` method and make a call to ``stop_all_threads(wait=True)``.

@@ example
def thread1():
    print('thread 1')


def thread2():
    print('thread 2')


def setup():
    py5.frame_rate(10)
    py5.launch_repeating_thread(thread1, name='thread 1', time_delay=1.2)
    py5.launch_repeating_thread(thread2, name='thread 2', time_delay=1.8)


def draw():
    print('running threads:', ', '.join(py5.list_threads()))

        py5.stop_all_threads()
