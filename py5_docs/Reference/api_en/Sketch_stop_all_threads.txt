wait: bool = False - wait for thread to exit before returning

@@ description
Stop all running threads. The ``wait`` parameter determines if the method call will return right away or wait for the threads to exit.

When the Sketch shuts down, ``stop_all_threads(wait=False)`` is called for you. If you would rather the Sketch waited for threads to exit, create an ``exiting`` method and make a call to ``stop_all_threads(wait=True)``.
