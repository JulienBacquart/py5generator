atan2(y: float, x: float) -> float

@@ variables
x: float - x-coordinate of the point
y: float - y-coordinate of the point

@@ description
Calculates the angle (in radians) from a specified point to the coordinate origin as measured from the positive x-axis. Values are returned as a float in the range from ``PI`` to ``-PI``. The ``atan2()`` function is most often used for orienting geometry to the position of the cursor. Note: The y-coordinate of the point is the first parameter, and the x-coordinate is the second parameter, due the the structure of calculating the tangent.

This function makes a call to the numpy ``atan2()`` function.

@@ example
def draw():
    py5.background(204)
    py5.translate(py5.width/2, py5.height/2)
    a = py5.atan2(py5.mouse_y - py5.height/2, py5.mouse_x - py5.width/2)
    py5.rotate(a)
    py5.rect(-30, -5, 60, 10)
