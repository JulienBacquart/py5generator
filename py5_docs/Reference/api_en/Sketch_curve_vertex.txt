@@ description
Specifies vertex coordinates for curves. This function may only be used between ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()`` and only when there is no MODE parameter specified to ``begin_shape()``. The first and last points in a series of ``curve_vertex()`` lines will be used to guide the beginning and end of a the curve. A minimum of four points is required to draw a tiny curve between the second and third points. Adding a fifth point with ``curve_vertex()`` will draw the curve between the second, third, and fourth points. The ``curve_vertex()`` function is an implementation of Catmull-Rom splines. Using the 3D version requires rendering with P3D (see the Environment reference for more information).
