@@ description
Specifies vertex coordinates for curves. This function may only be used between <b>beginShape()</b> and <b>endShape()</b> and only when there is no MODE parameter specified to <b>beginShape()</b>. The first and last points in a series of <b>curveVertex()</b> lines will be used to guide the beginning and end of a the curve. A minimum of four points is required to draw a tiny curve between the second and third points. Adding a fifth point with <b>curveVertex()</b> will draw the curve between the second, third, and fourth points. The <b>curveVertex()</b> function is an implementation of Catmull-Rom splines. Using the 3D version requires rendering with P3D (see the Environment reference for more information).
