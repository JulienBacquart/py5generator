get_action() -> int

@@ description
Return the key event's action. This value will always be implied by the triggered event function, but perhaps it might be useful to someone someday.

@@ example
def setup():
    py5.size(200, 200, py5.P2D)
    py5.rect_mode(py5.CENTER)


def draw():
    py5.square(py5.random(py5.width), py5.random(py5.height), 10)


def key_pressed(e):
    py5.println('key pressed:', e.get_action() == e.PRESS)


def key_released(e):
    py5.println('key released:', e.get_action() == e.RELEASE)


def key_typed(e):
    py5.println('key typed:', e.get_action() == e.TYPE)
