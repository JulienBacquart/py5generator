@@ description
Draws all geometry with smooth (anti-aliased) edges. This behavior is the default, so ``smooth()`` only needs to be used when a program needs to set the smoothing in a different way. The ``level`` parameter increases the amount of smoothness. This is the level of over sampling applied to the graphics buffer.

With the ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` renderers, ``smooth(2)`` is the default, this is called "2x anti-aliasing." The code ``smooth(4)`` is used for 4x anti-aliasing and ``smooth(8)`` is specified for "8x anti-aliasing." The maximum anti-aliasing level is determined by the hardware of the machine that is running the software, so ``smooth(4)`` and ``smooth(8)`` will not work with every computer.

The default renderer uses ``smooth(3)`` by default. This is bicubic smoothing. The other option for the default renderer is ``smooth(2)``, which is bilinear smoothing.

The ``smooth()`` function can only be set once within a Sketch. It must be called from the `settings()`` function. The :doc:`no_smooth` function also follows the same rules.
