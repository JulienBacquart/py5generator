@@ description
Create an animated GIF using the currently running sketch.

Use the -w argument to wait before starting.

The below example will create a 10 frame animated GIF saved to '/tmp/animated.gif'. The frames will be recorded 1 second apart after waiting 3 seconds. The animated GIF will display the frames with a 0.5 second delay between each one and will loop indefinitely.

```
    %py5animatedgif /tmp/animated.gif 10 1 0.5 -w 3
```
