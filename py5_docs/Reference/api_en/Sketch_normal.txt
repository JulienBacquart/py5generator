@@ description
Sets the current normal vector. Used for drawing three dimensional shapes and surfaces, ``normal()`` specifies a vector perpendicular to a shape's surface which, in turn, determines how lighting affects it. Processing attempts to automatically assign normals to shapes, but since that's imperfect, this is a better option when you want more control. This function is identical to ``gl_normal3f()`` in OpenGL.
