@@ description
Sets the current normal vector. Used for drawing three dimensional shapes and surfaces, ``normal()`` specifies a vector perpendicular to a shape's surface which, in turn, determines how lighting affects it. Processing attempts to automatically assign normals to shapes, but since that's imperfect, this is a better option when you want more control. This function is identical to ``gl_normal3f()`` in OpenGL.

@@ example
image = normal_.png

size(100, 100, P3D);
noStroke();
background(0);
pointLight(150, 250, 150, 10, 30, 50);
beginShape();
normal(0, 0, 1);
vertex(20, 20, -10);
vertex(80, 20, 10);
vertex(80, 80, -10);
vertex(20, 80, 10);
endShape(CLOSE);
