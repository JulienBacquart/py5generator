@@ description
Draws shapes to the display window. Shapes must be in the Sketch's "data" directory to load correctly. Py5 currently works with SVG, OBJ, and custom-created shapes. The ``shape`` parameter specifies the shape to display and the coordinate parameters define the location of the shape from its upper-left corner. The shape is displayed at its original size unless the ``c`` and ``d`` parameters specify a different size. The :doc:`sketch_shape_mode` function can be used to change the way these parameters are interpreted.

@@ example
image = Sketch_shape_0.png

def setup():
    global s
    s = py5.load_shape("bot.svg")


def draw():
    py5.shape(s, 10, 10, 80, 80)
