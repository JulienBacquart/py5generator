@@ description
Loads geometry into a variable of type `Py5Shape`. SVG and OBJ files may be loaded. To load correctly, the file must be located in the data directory of the current Sketch. In most cases, `load_shape()` should be used inside `setup()` because loading shapes inside `draw()` will reduce the speed of a Sketch.

Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.

If the shape file is not available or for whatever reason a shape cannot be created, an exception will be thrown.

This method is the same as [](sketch_load_shape) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_load_shape).
