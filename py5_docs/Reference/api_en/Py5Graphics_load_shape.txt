@@ description
Loads geometry into a variable of type `Py5Shape`. SVG and OBJ files may be loaded. To load correctly, the file must be located in the data directory of the current Sketch. In most cases, `load_shape()` should be used inside `setup()` because loading shapes inside `draw()` will reduce the speed of a Sketch.

Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.

If the file is not available or an error occurs, `None` will be returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt the program, however the `None` value may cause errors if your code does not check whether the value returned is `None`.

This method is the same as [](sketch_load_shape) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_load_shape).
