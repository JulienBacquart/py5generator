py5 is a new version of [**Processing**][processing] for Python 3.8+.

py5generator is a meta-programming project that creates py5.

If you have Java 11 installed on your computer, you can install py5 using pip:

```
pip install py5
```

[Detailed installation instructions](http://py5.ixora.io/install/) are available on the documentation website.

To view the actual installed py5 library, look at the [py5 repository][py5_repo]. The code makes the Java [**Processing**][processing] jars available to the CPython interpreter using [**JPype**][jpype].

The documentation website, [http://py5.ixora.io/](http://py5.ixora.io/), is a work in progress.
