py5 is a new version of [**Processing**][processing] for Python 3.8+. It makes the Java [**Processing**][processing] jars available to the CPython interpreter using [**JPype**][jpype].

py5generator is the meta-programming project that creates py5.

If you have Java 11 installed on your computer, you can install py5 using pip:

```
pip install py5
```

[Detailed installation instructions](http://py5.ixora.io/install/) are available on the documentation website. There are some [Special Notes for Mac Users](http://py5.ixora.io/tutorials/mac-users/) that you should read if you use OSX.

To view the actual installed py5 library, look at the [py5 repository][py5_repo].

The documentation website, [http://py5.ixora.io/](http://py5.ixora.io/), is a work in progress.
